Now Dirk plays for the Dallas Mavericks. He is mostly known as one of the best power forwards in the world. In 2002, he was a member of Germany’s national basketball team, which won bronze in the FIBA World Championship. What is more, Dirk was named as Eurobasket’s All-Europeans Player of the Year and also the Euroscar European Basketball Player of the Year. So how rich is Dirk Nowitzki? It has been estimated that Dirk’s net worth is more than 100 million dollars. Undoubtedly, this sum of money mainly has come from his career as a basketball player and as Dirk continues to play there is a high possibility that Dirk Nowitzki’s net worth will become even higher in the future.</p><h3>Dirk Nowitzki Net Worth $100 Million</h3><p>Dirk Werner Nowitzki, or simply known as Dirk Nowitzki, was born in 1978 in Germany. Both of his parents were involved in sports. Dirk’s mother was a basketball player, while his father a handball player. Dirk also has a sister who plays basketball as well. So there is no surprise that Nowitzki chose a career as a basketball player. When Dirk was only 15 years old, his talent to play basketball was noticed by Holger Geschwindner, who suggested to Dirk that he coach him, and help him to learn more about basketball. Holger was the person who encouraged Dirk to seek international success as a basketball player. It was worth it, because from that time Dirk Nowitzki’s net worth started to grow.</p><p>In 1994 Dirk became a part of DJK and was able to show his skills in basketball. Nowitzki was soon noticed by others and became more popular. In 1998 Dirk started to play for the Dallas Mavericks. At first his career in this club was not very smooth, but later Dirk was able to show a better game and that made him even more popular and acclaimed. It of course also added a lot to Dirk’s net worth. With every game Dirk became better and better at basketball and contributed a lot to many of his team’s wins. In the season of 2006 and 2007, Nowitzki was considered to be the Most Valuable Player. In 2011 Dirk helped his team win the NBA Finals and it of course had an impact on the growth of Dirk’s net worth. As mentioned before, Nowitzki continues playing for the Dallas Mavericks.</p><p>In addition to this, Dirk has also achieved a lot while being a part of Germany’s national basketball team. They won bronze in 2002 World Championships and Nowitzki added a lot to it. All in all, it could be said that Dirk Nowitzki is one of the best basketball players. During his career he has experienced ups and downs but has still been able to work hard and achieve a lot. Dirk will probably be considered to be one of the bests for a long time in the future. As he still plays there is a chance that Dirk Nowitzki’s net worth will grow in the future.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=20.323988644429><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Dirk Nowitzki</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$120 Million</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Salary</td><td>25.9&nbsp;million USD, 25.9&nbsp;million USD</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 19, 1978 (age 37</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Würzburg, Germany</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft 11 in (2.13 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>245 lbs (111 kg)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Basketball player</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Germany</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Jessica Olsson (m. 2012)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Malaika Nowitzki, Max Nowitzki</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Parents</td><td>Helga Nowitzki, Jorg Werner, Helga Nowitzki, Jorg Werner</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Silke Nowitzki</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Nicknames</td><td>German Wunderkind , Dirk Werner Nowitzki , The Germanator , Dunking Deutschman , Dirk Diggler</td></tr><tr readability=0.2><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/DirkNowitzkihttp://www.facebook.com/DirkNowitzki</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.2089552238806><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/swish41http://www.twitter.com/swish41</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.14736842105263><td>Google+</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://plus.google.com/100692109400153123695http://plus.google.com/100692109400153123695</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.4390243902439><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/swish41</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1185851</a></td></tr><tr readability=15><td>Awards</td><td>NBA Most Valuable Player Award, Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award, All-NBA Team, German Sportspersonality of the Year, Best NBA Player ESPY Award, Best Male Athlete ESPY Award, Euroscar, Mr. Europa, FIBA Europe Men's Player of the Year Award, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, All-Europeans Pl...</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Nominations</td><td>Laureus World Sports Award for Sportsman of the Year, Best International Athlete ESPY Award, Teen Choice Award for Choice Male Athlete, Laureus World Sports Award for Sportsman of the Year, Best International Athlete ESPY Award, Teen Choice Award for Choice Male Athlete</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=44.617146596859><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>1</td><td>Father of his 2nd child with Jessica Olsson, a son Max Nowitzki was born March 24, 2015 in Dallas.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>Playing Forward and Center for the Dallas Mavericks NBA Franchise [February 2003]</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>3</td><td>Father of his 1st child with Jassica Olsson, a daughter Malaika Nowitzki was born July 24, 2013 in Dallas.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>4</td><td>Good friends with basketball player Steve Nash.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>5</td><td>Chosen "European Basketball Player of the Year" for five years in a row from 2002 to 2006.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>6</td><td>First European-born player in NBA history to be named Most Valuable Player (May 2007).</td></tr><tr readability=2.7><td>7</td><td>Stated that he admires <a href=#>Larry Bird</a> for his combination of skills, work ethic and winner's mentality.</td></tr><tr readability=5.5897435897436><td>8</td><td>Once remarking he likes <a href=#>David Hasselhoff</a>'s song "Looking For Freedom", which was a big hit in Germany in the late 1980s, fans of Miami Heat always chanted "David Hasselhoff" when he visited the free throw line in the 2006 NBA finals.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>9</td><td>Nowitzki holds the curious NBA record for most defensive rebounds in one game without an offensive one - he had 21 versus Sacramento (23 February 2002).</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>10</td><td>At the 2002 World Basketball Championships, he led Germany to a bronze medal, their first ever medal at the Basketball World Championships.

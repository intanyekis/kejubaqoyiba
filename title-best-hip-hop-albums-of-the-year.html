Even though his triumphant stint in rehab has afforded him another lifeline, Brown’s only been sober for six months, whereas the concept in question was conceived when he was still trying to cut a deal with his demons. Yet, it sounds like he had already switched gears and was deeply contemplating a sustainable lifestyle long before he acted on it, almost as though his music was ahead of his day-to-day prognostics. Far beyond the excess of Old and somewhere between the curse of XXX and Atrocity Exhibition resides Quaranta — tired and resigned but, above all, buoyant. The LP is characterized by a mindfulness that Brown usually channels through humor on his podcast and sporadic attempts at stand-up comedy, but his now-somber tone deters from the thrill of probing death while simultaneously trying to circumvent it.</p><h2>Welcome 2 Collegrove – Lil Wayne & 2 Chainz</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/11/Lil-Wayne-21-Chainz-Benny-The-Butcher-Oprah-Gayle.jpg alt width=1000 height=1000 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>The years-in-the-making Welcome 2 Collegrove marks the second collaborative project by these longtime colleagues and close friends. The pair released Collegrove in 2016, an album overshadowed by Wayne’s label troubles and effectively a 2 Chainz solo effort with a handful of Lil Wayne features tacked on for good measure. The sequel might not see the duo vibing like Ghost and Rae on Only Built 4 Cuban Linx…, but their chemistry is evident, born out of a real kinship that authentically translates on wax. The album largely succeeds off the natural chemistry of its co-creators and the wide range of instrumentals that touch on several regional rap styles that both rappers learned to conquer during their decades-long careers. But the mayors of Collegrove keep it in the parking lot, displaying a flair and attitude endemic to rappers from south of the Mason–Dixon line.<br></p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2>The Night Shift – Larry June & Cardo</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/11/Larry-June-Cardo-The-Night-Shift-.jpg alt width=500 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>On The Night Shift, June’s second album this year with a legendary producer (in April, he released The Great Escape with The Alchemist), he adds just enough new wrinkles to keep his sound interesting. There were no sharp left turns; June still raps about women, biking, and smoothies (even interpolating the opening two bars from his own 2019 song “Tracy, CA” on “Stickin’ and Movin’”), but with some extra monetary flourishes. If you don’t believe his tried-and-true formula of rapp works, The Night Shift is a testament to the contrary; since 2019, the old school Beamers have become McLarens, the limos have become private jets, and the Kenzo sweaters have become Celine pants.Larry June is at his best when he sticks to his reliable recipe, compounding a few new concepts with each successive project. The Night Shift is June continuing his growth and evolution as an artist, however incremental it may be.</p><h2>And Then You Pray For Me – Westside Gunn</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/10/Westside-Gunn-And-Then-You-Pray-for-Me.webp alt width=600 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>His highly anticipated new release, which sits at a relatively hefty 21 tracks, did deliver many things we expected, like an AA Rashid intro, an interlude from his daughter berating our wealth, a poem from the always-dope Keisha Plum, hell, even a wrestling sample. As a great nod back to PFP, Cartier A. Williams appears again with a tap dancing interlude produced by Mr. Green (a producer we haven’t seen Gunn work with in years).<br></p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2>MIKE – Burning Desire</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/10/MIKE-Burning-Desire-scaled.webp alt width=2560 height=2560 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Since releasing his 2017 breakthrough May God Bless Your Hustle, MIKE has been on a prolific run. His catalogue has continued to expand and improve annually, with high-quality projects released consistently and MIKE himself appearing sharper with each outing. Running concurrently with that artistic growth, he seems to be settling into his role as an elder statesman in New York hip-hop’s underground. After being a mainstay in the community for years, the now 25-year-old has solidified himself as a figurehead in the scene – and with his latest LP, it seems he is acutely aware of just where he stands. With Burning Desire, MIKE brings forth his most self-assured work to date. The project is a no-holds-barred effort, existing as a lyrically dense, texturally diverse and unapologetically singular experience.</p><h2>Faith Is A Rock – MIKE & Wiki</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/09/mike-wiki-alchemist.jpg alt width=225 height=225 sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>After connecting this past November for the snack-sized One More EP, released in conjunction with Dutch streetwear brand Patta’s collaboration with Tommy Hilfiger, Wiki and MIKE have unleashed a full-length project, Faith Is A Rock, produced entirely by The Alchemist. Containing three songs from the EP—the collaborative “One More,” and solo tracks “Be Realistic” and “Odd Ways”—this 10-song project admirably delivers what core fans of both MCs had hoped for from a more substantial offering, with Al unsurprisingly in peak form. The duo’s chemistry is off the charts going back to back, keeping the wordplay complex enough to command multiple listens in order to fully decipher.<br></p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2>Another Triumph Of Ghetto Engineering – Open Mike Eagle</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/09/another-triumph-of-ghetto-engineering.jpg alt width=700 height=700 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Mike Eagle has always taken a grandiose approach to his rap music. From 2010’s Unapologetic Art Rap to 2016’s Hella Personal Film Festival and 2017’s opus Brick Body Kids Still Daydream, the Chicago-bred, LA-based underground broke superhero has often organized his work around a key theme or principle. His latest project, another triumph of ghetto engineering, is perhaps his finest work to date, or at least sets the stage for an epic debate amongst indie rap fans everywhere. This album has an explicit theme—the hard, often unrewarded work of Black artists everywhere—and one that bubbles beneath the surface and gives the album its brilliant thrust. Namely, this is a celebration of rap, of its beauty and brokenness, of those at the top of the game and those gone too soon to ever reach a peak. This is an album of triumphs and toils, of all that the game has given Mike and the ways in which it has fallen short for him. Mike is probably your favorite rapper’s favorite rapper, but more importantly, he’s your favorite rapper’s biggest rap fan.</p><h2>Sundial – NoName</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/08/NoName-Balloons-F.-Jay-Electronica.jpg alt width=1000 height=1000 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Noname blends Chicago’s deep-rooted history of poetry and soul-embalmed rap with the polyrhythms of traditionally African instrumentation n her brilliant new album Sundial. The catalyst to this is present here in Saba, Ben Nartey and AJ Halls’ collaboration in the production, bouncing rimshots on every off-beat, keeping pace with Noname’s slick boom-bap. In its introductory skit, “toxic” showcases a feminine-masculine mismatch in the understanding of love. The speaker emphasizes that love is commitment, and Noname expresses that same frustration with “toxic” love from people whose company she wouldn’t even prefer to her own. The yearning is paradoxical and so are Noname’s lovers, having babies with other women even though they had never shown maturity since the beginning. With the album, Noname flaunts a lyrical and spiritual masterclass, while also embracing her vulnerability and silencing anyone who doubted her.<br></p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2>The Patience – Mick Jenkins</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/08/Mick-Jenkins-Freddie-Gibbs-Show-Tell.jpg alt width=500 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>On The Patience, Jenkins’ familiar laidback cool is replaced with an anxious, angry bite. Jenkins is pissed – at the industry, fugazis (“Pasta”), money-grubbing peers (“Guapanese”), and his lack of recognition. A feeling of frustrated stasis is palpable throughout Jenkins’ excellent new album, which he mostly recorded while waiting out his CMG contract. His expression on the cover says it all: these songs were crafted during a period of deep frustration, when waiting began to feel like prison, when all he wanted was full control over his artistry. This project is a career reset – years of being a mainstay in underground circles and garnering acclaim from critics has still left Jenkins feeling overlooked. He’s ready to take his craft to a higher level. The Patience is a rewarding opening chapter, a satisfying burst of fresh air after a period of holding his breath. What comes next for Jenkins is unknown – but hopefully fans won’t have to wait too long to find out. He closes the album with a promise: “I’m just now stepping into what I feel like is full agency over my creativity, my artistry, my business, and even myself as a man.” And with this new album, he makes great strides to return to form when he was once considered the next great Chicago rapper.</p><h2>Signature – Joell Ortiz & L’Orange</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/07/Joell-Ortiz-LOrange-OG.jpg alt width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Between his multisyllabic rhyme schemes, agility and penchant for piling writerly details, rapping has never been a problem for Joell Ortiz — and it wasn’t on his mostly solid 2021 album, Autograph. There, his raps were generally sharp, with the project’s main issues being indistinct production and spurts of formulaic song tropes that occasionally halted its momentum. Those issues are almost entirely erased on Signature, a reimagining courtesy of soul production maestro, L’Orange. This time, Ortiz and L’Orange cut trite mid-2000s sounds and a few generic songs for a tighter, more emotionally intense offering. As sharp as it is tidy, the Autograph remix edition is an exercise in efficiency and sonic imagination, with the latter being a courtesy of a production dynamo who keeps it anything but stale. In the end, L’Orange left his mark on Signature by penning his own, making this version of Autograph a lot more legible.<br></p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2>Summer’s Mine – Babyface Ray</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/07/Babyface-Ray-Westside-Gunn-Fly-Gods.jpg alt width=500 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>2022 was the year that Babyface Ray made his mostly seamless transition from a regional rap star in Detroit to an international star with critical acclaim and mainstream appeal. The beautiful part is that he didn’t need to stray far from his signature sound to do so. His latest offering, Summer’s Mine, is a return to form after a slight meander off the path with his second project of last year, MOB. Now, as one of the biggest names in the Motor City’s booming hip-hop scene, Babyface Ray is continuing to put his city on his back with a continuous, effortless knack for unapologetic flexes, nervous flows, and introspective reflections. On Summer’s Mine, all of these characteristics combine for a masterful, all-encompassing body of work that finds Ray claiming the summer for the second year in a row – and succeeding.</p><h2>Ganger – Veeze</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/07/Veeze-Ganger-.webp alt width=600 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Though it should be considered a musical aggregate of Detroit’s rap scene, Ganger’s mixing is far ahead of its time within the realm of Hip Hop. Where more experimental, electronic-leaning acts change the mixing of vocals and instruments to distort their sound to become hardly recognizable, Veeze and his team of producers, including Ddot, Pooh Beats, and Bass Kid, toy with the idea of a slight change. The mixing on Ganger periodically boosts Veeze’s voice to be just a few decibels too high or too low, leaving his mumbles either subdued by the instrumental or overpowered by it. The result is a sound collage, where each element in each song feels repurposed under the direction of Veeze. On songs like, “WHOda1” and “Weekend,” the augmented volume of Veeze’s voice reflects a warm amity, whether it be whispering roasts into your ear or shedding his vulnerabilities a bit too close to the mic.</p><h2>Hard To Love – Moneybagg Yo</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/06/Moneybagg-Yo-Hard-To-Love.jpg alt width=225 height=225 sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Memphis rapper Moneybagg Yo solidified himself over the past five years as one of the most prolific emcees in Hip Hop’s current landscape. A string of LPs from 2018 to 2021 culminated in A Gangsta’s Pain, which found him advancing his formula of trap and drill bangers built around his distinctive flow, stark introspection, and disrespectful assortment of ad libs. Last year’s layoff found him becoming a single father due to the tragic murder of his ex-girlfriend, a cheating scandal involving his current partner, and a lean relapse. Still, all that couldn’t slow his artistic momentum. On Hard To Love, Moneybagg Yo addresses his real life pain in some of the most vulnerable material of his career without sacrificing the street anthems that made him a star. On Hard To Love, Moneybagg Yo delivers a well-balanced trap treatise on the bittersweetness of fame and the difficulty of living real life in the spotlight. Not many artists could blend those deeply personal elements with the bawdy trap anthems that keep clubs churning but Moneybagg Yo seems to be an exception.<br></p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2>Michael – Killer Mike</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/06/Killer-Mike-Michael-Square.jpg alt width=600 height=596 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>The moniker Killer Mike conjures a lengthy list of descriptors: searing truth-teller, 2nd Amendment-advocate, activist, MC. His new LP, Micheal, Executive-produced by No I.D., is an eclectic, heartfelt swirl of majestic soul and songwriting that’s as piercing as it is intimate. For this one, Mike explores tragedy and love with a mix of naked sincerity and the types of detail that usually has to be extracted from memory. As he’s explained in multiple interviews, this isn’t Killer Mike, it’s Michael Render, a human being that’s more than the sum of whichever labels we try to prescribe him.&nbsp;At about 54 minutes, Michael is a dense, but efficient body of thoughts and sounds, one embedded with instrumentation and gospel choirs you’d find in Black churches across the South. Of course, soundbeds like those are natural for Atlanta rappers of a certain age, but in this case, the dosage is more sizable — Mike’s deliberate move to incorporate the music of his childhood while paying homage to the culture that raised him.</p><h2>Hood Hottest Princess – Sexxy Red</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/06/Sexxy-Red-Skeeyee.jpg alt width=1000 height=1000 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>If Detroit has become the de facto center of the universe for a new generation of street rappers with a penchant for deadpan punchlines and copious punch-ins, then Memphis is something of a sister city. Led by the producer triumvirate of Tay Keith, Hitkidd, and Juicy J, the city’s resurgent scene has expanded far beyond Tennessee’s borders to cultivate a new lineage of raunchy, inescapable club-rap anthems. St. Louis’ Sexyy Red is the latest emcee to flip Three 6 Mafia’s tried and true formula into a contender for Song of the Summer: Her horny-as-hell breakout single “Pound Town” is a graphic, often hilarious celebration of casual sex that’s guaranteed to be a floor-filler for months to come. Though it can be tough to follow up bottled lightning with a full-length project, Sexyy Red’s sophomore mixtape Hood Hottest Princess manages to succeed by sticking to her strengths. Light on features and capped at a lean 30 minutes, the release is packed back to front with hard-hitting nu-crunk energy and pornographic quotables—exactly the kind of material anyone pressing play is looking for.<br></p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2>MAPS – billy woods & Kenny Segal</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/05/billy-woods-Kenny-Segal-Maps--300x300.jpg alt width=300 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>billy woods describes Maps, his exceptional new album and second collaboration with producer Kenny Segal, as a “post-pandemic” record, an interesting shift from the quarantine-album narrative that dominated the past couple of years. And Maps is exactly that, chronicling woods’ return to touring as the general population hesitantly removed their masks and walked back inside. He wrote a lot of the record on the road, documenting the mundanities and curiosities of life as a touring artist, especially one with a larger, more international audience than before. “Soundcheck” describes his need to escape the tedium of its titular activity, opting instead to find the nearest Szechuan restaurant. He fights jet lag on “Bad Dreams Are Only Dreams” and smokes weed in a hotel room during “Facetime,” listening to festival goers chase oblivion after a Playboi Carti set.</p><h2>WON’T HE DO IT – Conway The Machine</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/05/Wont-He-Do-It-Digital-Cover-Art-300x300.jpg alt="Wont He Do It Digital Cover Art" width=300 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>While the metrics for what constitutes a great MC may not be as universal as they once were — as seen from the endless debates and comparisons on Hip Hop Twitter — it’s difficult not to consider Conway The Machine as one of the better lyricists of the day. Rightfully, that has been a bottom-line takeaway for everything he’s dropped since his 2020 debut studio album, From King To A GOD. Though his penchant for darker vibes may have once led some listeners and critics to attempt to confine and categorize his style, Won’t He Do It is his best example yet of why that’s impossible.<br></p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2>SREMM 4 LIFE – Rae Sremmurd</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/04/Rae-Sremmurd-Sremm-4-Life-home-300x300.jpg alt width=300 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Ten years after dropping a debut jam-packed with up-tempo club bangers, the brothers behind Hip Hop duo Rae Sremmurd find themselves genre statesman enjoying every conceivable trapping of success. Channeling the same dizzying energy that fueled their initial ascent, Slim Jxmmi and Swae Lee keep the party bumping with Sremm 4 Life. But although the scenery and the musical backdrop is much the same, the brothers tap into a level of introspection that only comes with age that they’ve never quite harnessed before.</p><h2>GLORIOUS GAME – Black Thought & El Michels Affair</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/03/Black-Thought-El-Michels-Affair-Glorious-Game-300x300.jpg alt width=300 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Coming off the critically acclaimed Cheat Codes — a runner-up for the DX Best Hip Hop Album Of 2022 award — Tariq Trotter, better known as Black Thought, once again asserts his Zeus-level pen with Glorious Game, a collaborative LP with&nbsp;El Michels Affair (headed by one of his fave producers, Leon Michels). Playing out as a stage-worthy one-person show, Thought remains endearingly personal throughout the tightly curated 31-minute project, walking us through the sights, sounds, smells and sensibilities instilled coming up in the Point Breeze neighborhood of South Philadelphia.</p><h2>GENERATIONAL CURSE – ICECOLDBISHOP</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/04/Icecoldbishop-Generational-Curse-Square-300x300.jpg alt width=300 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>GENERATIONAL CURSE is a unique project from performance to production, especially regarding debuts in 2023. The music sounds fresh; it’s layered and anchored by its willingness to be heard. While Icecoldbishop adds plenty of social commentary throughout the songs, it never feels corny or shoved down your throat. Bishop’s storytelling is exceptional, learning from generations of west coast emcees who created the blueprint. GENERATIONAL CURSE excites the future, and for Bishop, the future couldn’t be brighter.<br></p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2>Gumbo – Young Nudy</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/03/Young-Nudy-Gumbo-300x300.webp alt width=300 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Young Nudy operates in the realm of neon distortion. Since 2016, the 30-year-old stylist has blended his sticky rasp and macabre gunplay with beats that could soundtrack Zelda, creating songs that are jarring and immersive. With its vibrantly sinister sounds, pristine sequencing and spurts of Nudy’s underrated humor and flow versatility, Gumbo is just more evidence of his status as one of Atlanta’s most unique artists. Maintaining its cohesion while avoiding monotony, Nudy’s latest is at once chill and animated — an extravagant adventure that’s as controlled as it is fun. Released seven months after last year’s excellent EA Monster, the effort continues Nudy’s stream of strong projects. The LP plays out the way its title suggests. Murderous quips, onomatopoeias and agile flows get steeped deep into eclectic beats. The varied sounds begin to blend with the flavors next to it, and like the best Nudy projects, Gumbo highlights the contrasting ingredients while creating a flavor all its own.</p><h2>Even God Has A Sense Of Humor – Maxo</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/02/maxo-free-new-single-300x300.jpg alt=maxo-free-new-single width=300 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>The California-based Maxo raps to tell deeply personal stories – not to flex flashy rhymes. Over atmospheric droning or dreamy jazz-fueled production, the 28-year-old grapples with the painful parts of human existence: depression, self-doubt, shaken faith. Maxo is in a more positive headspace these days, but debut LP Even God Has a Sense of Humor is billed as a tribute to and a final rehash of the troubled days leading up to his present at the precipice of mainstream success. Socially conscious and artistically daring, Maxo creates some magical moments on Even God Has a Sense of Humor.<br></p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2>Slae Season 3 – DaeMoney</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/02/daemoney-slae-season-3-reg-300x300.jpg alt=daemoney-slae-season-3-reg width=300 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>DaeMoney has spent the majority of his life around rappers, learning the craft from his uncle Babyface Ray at a young age and even recording a pre-written verse on a Team Eastside track when he was just six. His latest album, Slae Season 3, feels like the work of a seasoned vet, delving into a neurotic level of introspection. While the series’ previous entry, released in 2021, still felt tethered to Detroit conventions like frantic harp melodies and squelching bass, SS3 delves into a murkier aesthetic that better suits DaeMoney’s lethargic flow. Emphasizing his vocals in the mix, the production is impressionistic, allowing a blend of detuned synths and sleepy string samples to seep into a backdrop of distorted 808s. The effect is more mid-fi than lo-fi, but the subtle influence of artists like Earl Sweatshirt and Lucki (who makes a guest appearance on “Who Is That?”) is evident in his taste for the muffled and understated.</p><h2>Mind Of A Saint – Skyzoo</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/01/skyzoo-mind-of-a-saint-300x300.jpg alt width=300 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Fully thematic albums can be a mixed bag. If an artist’s concept is too complicated or obscure, listeners will lose interest. Conversely, if it’s too loose, artists open themselves up to criticism for poor execution. Brooklyn MC and ATL restaurant owner <a class=underline-link href=#>Skyzoo’s</a> latest release, <a class=underline-link href=#>The Mind Of A Saint: A Soliloquy by Skyzoo</a>, is a master class in pulling off a conceptual album without breaking character or losing steam (no easy feat). The album is told from the point of view of drug kingpin Franklin Saint, a character in <a href=#>Snowfall</a>, a drama co-created by the late <a class=underline-link href=#>John Singleton</a>, set in 1980s Los Angeles at the start of the crack cocaine epidemic. Throughout the 10-song affair, Skyzoo’s penchant for crafting lyrically rich, rewind-worthy Hip Hop loaded with easter eggs shines as brightly as ever, with an almost mind-boggling level of attention to detail. Whether it’s telling the engineer that he’s not used to the studio as he’s from a “different life” on the song “100 to One” or describing Franklin telling his <a href=#>friend Leon</a> about working on an album on the intro to “Brick by Brick” (“Yo Saint, I know you’re going to get all poetic”), he fully commits to his character.<br></p><p>AD LOADING...</p><h2>Indiana Jones – Boldy James & RichGains</h2><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/02/Boldy-James-and-RichGains-Indiana-Jones-1674226852-300x300.jpeg alt width=300 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Just a few weeks after it was reported that rapper Boldy James had been in a car accident in the Detroit area that left him with broken vertebrae in his neck and other injuries, the MC (who has since moved to a rehab center) released a sobering collaborative project with Rich Gains, Indiana Jones. Boldy’s non-assuming delivery and melancholy aura seem almost elastic when applied to the sonic signatures of different producers—which makes, for example, his Nicholas Craven-helmed Fair Exchange No Robbery sound so different from his work with Futurewave (Mr. Ten08), Alchemist or Real Bad Man. In this case, Rich Gains, half of the production duo Blended Babies (with partner JP), has given the Detroit MC an eclectic vibe that pushes him in ambitious new directions. As a result, Boldy delivers incredibly intriguing tracks balanced against some of his bleakest bars in recent memory.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZmZYJ5gY6toK2klWOvpr%2FTZp%2BiqF2dvLF5wKWZrqWjYrynedOhnGaxlZa%2F</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftitle-best-hip-hop-albums-of-the-year.html&text=Best%20Hip%20Hop%20Albums%20of%202023%20...%20So%20Far%20%7c%20Top%20Hip%20Hop%20Albums&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftitle-best-hip-hop-albums-of-the-year.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftitle-best-hip-hop-albums-of-the-year.html&title=Best%20Hip%20Hop%20Albums%20of%202023%20...%20So%20Far%20%7c%20Top%20Hip%20Hop%20Albums" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftitle-best-hip-hop-albums-of-the-year.html&title=Best%20Hip%20Hop%20Albums%20of%202023%20...%20So%20Far%20%7c%20Top%20Hip%20Hop%20Albums" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftitle-best-hip-hop-albums-of-the-year.html&title=Best%20Hip%20Hop%20Albums%20of%202023%20...%20So%20Far%20%7c%20Top%20Hip%20Hop%20Albums" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftitle-best-hip-hop-albums-of-the-year.html&description=Best%20Hip%20Hop%20Albums%20of%202023%20...%20So%20Far%20%7c%20Top%20Hip%20Hop%20Albums" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-was-the-cast-scandal-in-downton-abbey.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Downton Abbey Was A Nightmare To Film For Many Cast Members">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./richard-gere-mansion-venta-nueva-york-alejandra-silva-3363391.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="As es la espectacular mansin de 25 millones de euros de Richard Gere y Alejandra Silva">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

The cameo was very short, but did not age well, at least from a fan perspective. Stiller was urged to remove the scene. We're going to reveal how Stiller reacted to the fans, and other films that actually removed Trump scenes in the past.

The film was a decent success at the box office, but would later turn into a cult-classic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film featured several cameos, and that included a brief appearance from both Donald and Melania Trump. Interviewed on the red carpet, Donald says with Melania by his side, "Without Derek Zoolander, male modeling wouldn't be what it is today."</p><p>Following Trump's controversial Presidency, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Stiller faced fan backlash over the scene</a>. It turned into a nightmare for the actor, with others urging him to remove the scene completely from the reruns of the film. Despite the backlash, Stiller refused.</p><p>He said, “I’ve had people reach out to me and say, you should edit Donald Trump out of ‘Zoolander.'" Stiller continues, “But at the end of the day, that was a time when that exists and that happened."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"There were so many movies [back then] that had a silly cameo from Donald Trump. He represented a certain thing. We were shooting at the now defunct VH1 Fashion Awards… and as people were coming up the red carpet, we pulled them aside and asked them to talk about Derek Zoolander, and so Trump and Melania did that.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/your-paragraph-text-2024-04-02t125027-120.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Judge Judy Had The Perfect Response Years Ago When Asked By Stephen Colbert About Getting A Salary From Donald Trump">Judge Judy Had The Perfect Response Years Ago When Asked By Stephen Colbert About Getting A Salary From Donald Trump</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Judge Judy was asked by Stephen Colbert about working with Donald Trump, but it seems like the salary didn't cut it.</p><p>Although Ben Stiller didn't find it necessary to remove Trump from the films, others felt differently...</p><h2 id=donald-trump-39-s-cameo-in-home-alone-2-was-removed-in-canada>Donald Trump's Cameo In Home Alone 2 Was Removed In Canada</h2><p>That's right, in Canada, Donald Trump was removed from Home Alone 2. Trump actually tweeted out, "I guess Justin [Trudeau] doesn't much like my making him pay up on NATO or Trade! The movie will never be the same! (just kidding)."</p><p>CBC issued a statement about his removal, calling it a coincidence. According to a rep, Trump was removed from the film back in 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/untitled-design-23.png><p>"This happens regularly with films adapted for television," Thompson said. "The scene with Donald Trump was one of several that were cut from the movie as none of them were integral to the plot. These edits were done in 2014."</p><p>As for Home Alone 2 director Chris Columbus, he revealed Trump basically forced himself into the film. “So we agreed to put him in the movie, and when we screened it for the first time the oddest thing happened: People cheered when Trump showed up on-screen. So I said to my editor, ‘Leave him in the movie. It’s a moment for the audience.’ But he did bully his way into the movie.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/your-paragraph-text-2024-02-29t160417-793.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Dr. Phil Got Confrontational With An Uncomfortable Jimmy Kimmel After Donald Trump Was Brought Up ">Dr. Phil Got Confrontational With An Uncomfortable Jimmy Kimmel After Donald Trump Was Brought Up</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>It seemed clear that ABC cut some footage during Jimmy Kimmel and Dr. Phil's heated debate about Donald Trump.</p><p>Trump didn't exactly agree with the director's assessment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I was very busy, and didn’t want to do it,” Trump wrote. “They were very nice, but above all, persistent. I agreed, and the rest is history! That little cameo took off like a rocket, and the movie was a big success, and still is, especially around Christmas time. People call me whenever it is aired.”</p><p>He continues, “That cameo helped make the movie a success, but if they felt bullied, or didn’t want me, why did they put me in, and keep me there, for over 30 years? Because I was, and still am, great for the movie, that’s why!”</p><h2 id=matt-damon-also-revealed-that-donald-trump-tried-to-force-his-way-into-scent-of-a-woman>Matt Damon Also Revealed That Donald Trump Tried To Force His Way Into Scent Of A Woman</h2><p>Matt Damon shared a similar experience to Chris Columbus. Damon said that if you planned on using one of Trump's buildings, expect a request for a cameo in the film. That took place for Scent of a Woman. Damon called the shoot a waste of time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/screen-shot-2024-02-16-at-2-03-49-pm.png><p>"The deal was that if you wanted to shoot in one of his buildings, you had to write him in a part," Damon said. "[Director] Martin Brest had to write something in Scent of a Woman—and the whole crew was in on it. You have to waste an hour of your day with a bullsh– shot: Donald Trump walks in and Al Pacino's like, 'Hello, Mr. Trump!'—you had to call him by name—and then he exits. You waste a little time so that you can get the permit, and then you can cut the scene out. But I guess in Home Alone 2 they left it in."</p><p>This time, Trump did not comment on Damon's assessment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiknqSRo7aiecOopZqklGLBs8HMqWSzp5%2Bhrq%2BwxKtkp6GXncGurdGeZJudnmLAtbXLpZyrZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmelania-donald-trump-zoolander-nightmare-ben-stiller.html&text=Melania%20And%20Donald%20Trump%27s%20Five-Second%20Cameo%20In%20Zoolander%20Was%20A%20Nightmare%20For%20Ben%20Stiller&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmelania-donald-trump-zoolander-nightmare-ben-stiller.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmelania-donald-trump-zoolander-nightmare-ben-stiller.html&title=Melania%20And%20Donald%20Trump%27s%20Five-Second%20Cameo%20In%20Zoolander%20Was%20A%20Nightmare%20For%20Ben%20Stiller" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmelania-donald-trump-zoolander-nightmare-ben-stiller.html&title=Melania%20And%20Donald%20Trump%27s%20Five-Second%20Cameo%20In%20Zoolander%20Was%20A%20Nightmare%20For%20Ben%20Stiller" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmelania-donald-trump-zoolander-nightmare-ben-stiller.html&title=Melania%20And%20Donald%20Trump%27s%20Five-Second%20Cameo%20In%20Zoolander%20Was%20A%20Nightmare%20For%20Ben%20Stiller" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmelania-donald-trump-zoolander-nightmare-ben-stiller.html&description=Melania%20And%20Donald%20Trump%27s%20Five-Second%20Cameo%20In%20Zoolander%20Was%20A%20Nightmare%20For%20Ben%20Stiller" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ten-most-influential-jazz-albums.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ten Most Influential Jazz Albums">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./john-gokongwei-jr-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John Gokongwei Jr. Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

Early on in her career, Raven showed that she is a force to be reckoned with, dropping music videos and touring all while still maintaining a prestigious acting career. The star made her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">first appearance on the Disney Channel</a> in 1999 in the popular Disney Channel Original Movie Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century. A few short years later she landed her own leading role with the network thanks to That's So Raven, which followed the daily life of a teenage psychic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While still in the midst of a successful music and acting career, Raven-Symoné shifted her focus to work on The View as a host. This was Raven's first step into appearing as a host on a live television show, an experience she said allowed her to learn a lot about the industry.</p><h2 id=raven-left-the-view-to-go-back-to-disney>Raven Left The View To Go Back To Disney</h2><p>Raven-Symoné <a href=#>initially appeared on The View</a> a few times as a guest host before officially joining as a full-time member of the crew in 2015 alongside the likes of Whoopi Goldberg, Paula Faris, Candace Cameron Bure, and Joy Behar.</p><p>Her career on the popular daytime television show would not last for very long, however, with the actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">announcing on air</a> that she would be leaving her position as a host on The View in 2016 to get back to work with her long-time partners Disney.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="15 Photos Of Raven-Symoné Since 'That's So Raven'">15 Photos Of Raven-Symoné Since 'That's So Raven'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The announcement that she is partnering with Disney Channel again was very well received by fans of That's So Raven, who were excited about what Raven-Symoné and Disney had planned for the character that she popularized in the early 2000s.</p><p>And they wouldn't have to wait very long for Raven's new project to air, with the new sitcom dubbed Raven's Home premiering on the Disney Channel in 2017, just one year after her departure from The View.</p><p>The show was very well received, with its pilot episode boasting 3.5 million viewers, a high number for a kids' show.</p><p>Disney's Vice President of Original Programming has also <a href=#>expressed continued excitement at working with Raven-Symoné</a>, telling fans that they "have much more in store" for her and Raven's Home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-disney-star-got-candid-about-her-time-on-the-view>The Disney Star Got Candid About Her Time On The View</h2><p>While her time on The View was short and filled with some interesting controversies, Raven-Symoné did reveal that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she felt as though she was "catfished" into being on the show</a>. In an interview with THEM, she admitted that she masked her identity while she was on the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Why Howard Stern Thinks 'The View' Is Ridiculous">Why Howard Stern Thinks 'The View' Is Ridiculous</a></span></p><p>She continued on to complement Whoopi Goldberg, <a href=#>who has her own set of controversies tied to The View</a>, calling her ex-co-host "amazing" and crediting her as part of the reason she decided to commit to The View as a host.</p><p>Symone admits that she would never go through an experience like The View again, but that she learned a lot from doing live television, saying that "it is a skill to be on live television and voice your opinions" and admitted that she has to apologize a few times for some things she has said on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also is of the opinion that many in her position, who grow up in the spotlight, end up resorting to their bodies or their sexuality to continue building their careers, something she wanted to completely avoid, and that is part of the reason she opted to host The View as well.</p><h2 id=the-view-is-no-stranger-to-a-rotating-cast>The View Is No Stranger To A Rotating Cast</h2><p>The View has been on television since 1997 when Barbara Walters, Debbie Matenopoulos, Star Jones and Meredith Vieira, and Joy Behar were the original hosts of the show, and there has been a plethora of hosts since then.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Twitter Users Speculate About Who Will Be Meghan McCain's Replacement On 'The View'">Twitter Users Speculate About Who Will Be Meghan McCain's Replacement On 'The View'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reporter Lisa Ling joined in 1999 before leaving the show in 2002, being replaced by Elisabeth Hasselback the following year. Television personality Rosie O'Donnell, who already had experience thanks to her own television show, joined briefly for seasons 10 and 18.</p><p>Whoopi Goldberg took the helm in 2007 and has been on since then as one of the main hosts.</p><p>Goldberg has worked with the likes of Sherri Shepherd, Jenny McCarthy, Nicolle Wallace, Rosie Perez, Raven-Symoné, Michelle Collins, Candace Cameron Bure, Paula Faris, Jedediah Bilah, Meghan McCain, and Abby Huntsman, all of which have made their exit from the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Additional hosts for the show include Sara Haines, Sunny Hostin, Ana Navarro and Alyssa Farah Griffin. It seems that, like Raven-Symoné, many of the hosts of The View are not immune to controversies, with several of the hosts having to make public apologies for statements they have made.</p><p>Others, like Meghan McCain, cited leaving due to a negative experience working on the show, something that some believe Raven may have experienced as well. Either which way, fans of Raven are thrilled to have her back home at the Disney Channel and are excited to see what she is going to do with their partnership going forward.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbaledGarZ6mXajGrrvNnmSlnZGrsm7Ax55kr6GVrHw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-raven-symone-leave-the-view.html&text=Raven-Symon%20Says%20She%20Was%20%26quot%3bCatfished%26quot%3b%20Into%20Working%20On%20The%20View&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-raven-symone-leave-the-view.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-raven-symone-leave-the-view.html&title=Raven-Symon%20Says%20She%20Was%20%26quot%3bCatfished%26quot%3b%20Into%20Working%20On%20The%20View" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-did-raven-symone-leave-the-view.html&title=Raven-Symon%20Says%20She%20Was%20%26quot%3bCatfished%26quot%3b%20Into%20Working%20On%20The%20View" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-raven-symone-leave-the-view.html&title=Raven-Symon%20Says%20She%20Was%20%26quot%3bCatfished%26quot%3b%20Into%20Working%20On%20The%20View" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-raven-symone-leave-the-view.html&description=Raven-Symon%20Says%20She%20Was%20%26quot%3bCatfished%26quot%3b%20Into%20Working%20On%20The%20View" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./rossif-sutherland-married-wife-net-worth-earnings-facts-wiki-bio.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rossif Sutherland Married, Wife, Net Worth, Earnings, Facts, Wiki-Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./laura-branigan.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Laura Branigan">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

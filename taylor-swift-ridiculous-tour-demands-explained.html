However, numerous news outlets have picked up the story and fans have already weighed in. And they had some thoughts...</p><p>This article will delve into <strong>Taylor Swift's alleged crazy 2024 Eras Tour rider requests</strong> as well as touch upon the rider that was leaked back in 2008. Following that, we will reveal who pays for tour riders.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-39-s-demands-for-her-dressing-room-during-her-eras-tour-caused-a-commotion>Taylor Swift's Demands For Her Dressing Room During Her Eras Tour Caused A Commotion</h2><p><a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift's outrageous yearly earnings have made her one of the richest stars in the world</strong></a>, so it's not exactly shocking that she would have grown an appetite of an A-lister. When comparing her<strong> two allegedly leaked tour riders, one from 2008 and one from 2024</strong>, there is a noteworthy difference in diva-like demands. While neither tour rider has been authenticated by Swift, her reps, or a third party, fans have already formulated opinions on them. Thanks to sites like The Daily Mail, Parade, and Perez Hilton, <strong>Swifties have been given access to the "August" singer's supposed demands and they have roasted her for it</strong>.</p><p>Not unlike how fans had a visceral reaction to <a href=#>how much Mark Wahlberg spends on food</a>, Swifties have some thoughts on the alleged tour rider from Taylor Swift's Eras tour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taylor-swift-refused-to-stream-her-eras-tour-film-after-she-felt-as-though-the-studio-s-vision-didn-t-align-front-deposit-back-commons-licences.jpg><p><strong>What Is A Tour Rider?</strong></p><p>According to Parade, a tour rider is a list of requirements that a performer or band has for a venture they will be playing at These requests can be guidelines for treatment, requests for food, booze, or drugs, or completely over-the-top diva-like requests. For example, Parade claimed that an old Justin Beiber tour rider demanded 10 luxury Sedans, a private jet on standby, and a massage table.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Perez Hilton, a<strong> Portuguese publication called Correio da Manhã leaked a supposed tour rider </strong>from Swift's Eras tour. The demands were specific to her concert at the Estádio da Luz venue in Portugal in May 2024, but they may not be exclusive to them. As per the tour ride, <strong>Swift demands that her dressing room is decorated with Swarovski crystals</strong>. While Swift typically presents an approachable, 'all-American' image, this specific is far from it. One fan on Perez Hilton's acclaimed site pointed out just how much of a diva move it is to make this kind of demand:</p><p>"The crystal-decorated dressing room is pretty damn diva 😆 🤣 go off girl!!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of this, Taylor Swift reportedly<strong> desired that her dressing room be "filled" with over 100 bottles of wine</strong> before her arrival. Which wines Swift requests be present is not included in the yet-to-be-authenticated leaked tour rider. If this is real, the wine is likely for her entourage and crew after each concert.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/travis-kelce-continues-to-come-clean_gr-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Travis Kelce Continues To Come Clean About If He Actually Likes Taylor Swift's Music">Travis Kelce Continues To Come Clean About If He Actually Likes Taylor Swift's Music</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's fans want to know if Travis Kelce really likes his girlfriend's music.</p><p>But alcohol is not the only thing required in Taylor Swift's dressing room. According to Parade, Swift also <strong>wanted her room filled with "a wide variety of flowers and fruits,”</strong> including oranges and avocados (which are a fruit... look it up). In addition, the "My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys" singer also requested iced tea from Starbucks and a slice of pumpkin bread ordered to her hotel precisely at 11 a.m. each morning.</p><p><strong>What Is Taylor Swift's Starbucks Order?</strong></p><p>According to 7news.com.au, Swift's rider has a very specific Starbucks order to be delivered each morning. it's rumored to be the following: “1 Grande ICED Caramel Latte with 2 Sweet-N-Lows, 1 Grande ICED Americano with 2 Sweet-N-Lows and soy milk, and 1 slice of Pumpkin loaf.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/how-much-taylor-swift-makes-per-concert-after-taxes-and-expenses-2.jpg><p>Taylor Swift's alleged Eras tour rider also includes an assortment of food and beverages for her and her crew.

In it, Swift almost entirely just requested food such as chocolate milk, grape juice, Tositots Tortilla Chips, a stick of butter, Kraft Shredded Cheddar Cheese, Kraft Dinner, Twizzlers, Diet Pepsi, cottage cheese, and a lot of olives. Fans on Reddit ripped on Swift's requests. Many of their comments were summed up by one fan who said the following:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I'm crying I laughed so hard."</p><h2 id=who-pays-for-taylor-swift-39-s-tour-rider>Who Pays For Taylor Swift's Tour Rider?</h2><p>According to Parade,<strong> tour riders are a common practice for just about every single type of artist</strong>, regardless of genre. The requests artists make of a specific venue may include things like safety requirements, allergies and dietary restrictions, or contain a list of demands for their dressing room. On occasion, these demands can stretch into ridiculous territories.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/taylor-swift-live-performance.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Who pays for the tour rider requests can vary on the situation. If the artist is playing at a festival, <strong>the promoters will cover the costs</strong>. In the case of a big concert like Taylor Swift's, the concert promoter will tend to pay the bill. Typically, there's a negotiation surrounding the contents of the rider.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lop6xqq%2FUpaauq12pvLa%2BjJ2cppmemcBusdepo5qhnpqxcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-ridiculous-tour-demands-explained.html&text=Fans%20Roast%20Taylor%20Swift%20For%20Her%20Ridiculous%20Tour%20Demands%20That%20Allegedly%20Leaked&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-ridiculous-tour-demands-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-ridiculous-tour-demands-explained.html&title=Fans%20Roast%20Taylor%20Swift%20For%20Her%20Ridiculous%20Tour%20Demands%20That%20Allegedly%20Leaked" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftaylor-swift-ridiculous-tour-demands-explained.html&title=Fans%20Roast%20Taylor%20Swift%20For%20Her%20Ridiculous%20Tour%20Demands%20That%20Allegedly%20Leaked" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-ridiculous-tour-demands-explained.html&title=Fans%20Roast%20Taylor%20Swift%20For%20Her%20Ridiculous%20Tour%20Demands%20That%20Allegedly%20Leaked" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-ridiculous-tour-demands-explained.html&description=Fans%20Roast%20Taylor%20Swift%20For%20Her%20Ridiculous%20Tour%20Demands%20That%20Allegedly%20Leaked" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./local-la-meteorologist-collapses-on-live-tv-in-frightening-moment.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="LA meteorologist collapses on live TV in frightening moment">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./christine-kellogg-darrin-net-worth-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christine Kellogg-Darrin Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

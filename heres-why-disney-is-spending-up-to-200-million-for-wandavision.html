We are seeing the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MCU</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DC</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Star Wars</a> all make a concentrated efforts to connect their big screen and television properties for fan consumption, and over time, we are going to get some truly incredible moments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Disney+ has been a monumental success, and they are launching a number of MCU shows, including&nbsp;WandaVision. That series, which will feature both Scarlet Witch and Vision, looks terrific, and once it debuts in January, people are going to see what $200 million can do.</p><p>Let’s look and see why Disney is shelling out so much money for its MCU shows!</p><h2 id=episodes-can-cost-up-to-25-million>Episodes Can Cost Up To $25 Million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6E5CBE0C-5FB7-43FD-9E29-7BE54B50944A.jpeg><p>To get the complete picture here, we need to take things down to the nitty-gritty and get a breakdown of episode costs. After all, this is going to show just how much Disney is willing to pump into its upcoming MCU projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It has been reported that episodes for&nbsp;WandaVision and the future MCU shows can cost up to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$25 million</a> to make. This is a staggering budget episode that Disney will be working with, and it has been turning heads since it was announced. There are films made for less money than it will take to make a single episode of these shows, which means that Disney has supreme confidence here.</p><p>There are shows out there with huge budgets, including none other than&nbsp;The Mandalorian, which is also a Disney+ mainstay. To be fair,&nbsp;The Mandalorian has been a monumental achievement by Disney, and a huge reason why is that it is doing some unique and interesting things with&nbsp;Star Wars. This has kept people coming back for more, and Disney is hoping to replicate this with&nbsp;WandaVision.</p><p>The estimated cost of these MCU shows is pretty incredible, but Disney believes that they have a winner here. After all, they do share a unique connection to what has become the premier movie franchise on the planet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Major Stars Joining The MCU Next Year</a></span></p><h2 id=the-mcu-connection>The MCU Connection</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/4D210455-7EFE-4777-BCBB-316A222A1B0D.jpeg><p>Now, we have seen television projects link up with what has been going on with big-screen franchises before, but things are being taken to another level these days. While shows like&nbsp;The Mandalorian have direct connections to their franchises without directly interfering with what has been going on, the MCU shows we are going to be seeing will have consequences for the big screen MCU flicks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Instead of just building a universe on Disney+ and calling it a day like the franchise did with Netflix shows liked&nbsp;Daredevil and&nbsp;Jessica Jones, Disney is now looking to have shows that cause a ripple effect in the MCU. There have already been reports&nbsp;circulating that&nbsp;WandaVision is going to have a direct tie to the upcoming&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Doctor Strange sequel</a>, meaning that MCU fans will be needing to tune into this show to get a true lead-in to that film.</p><p>What this means, in the long run, is that the millions of fans that the MCU has roped in over the years will have a genuine incentive to watch these projects. The Netflix shows did not play much of a part in the overall MCU, so it wasn’t really that important to watch them. What we are seeing now, however, is that Disney wants fans migrating to their platform to stay current with the latest MCU happenings.</p><p>This is brilliant by the House of Mouse, honestly. These shows are featuring key characters like Scarlet Witch, Vision, Falcon, Winter Soldier, and Hawkeye, and they will also be introducing more characters down the line. As such, they know that this massive investment is going to pay off in a major way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, with this massive budget in effect for these shows, how do they stack up against the MCU’s biggest movies yet?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Which MCU Role Did Matthew McConaughey Want To Play?</a></span></p><h2 id=how-it-compares-to-mcu-movies>How It Compares To MCU Movies</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CFE0C4FD-8F90-4C60-B424-0617E716579E.jpeg><p>Spending up to $200 million to make a television series is a bold choice by Disney, but they are doing things the right way. However, it does make people wonder how this stacks up against the actual MCU films.</p><p>We have seen MCU movies like&nbsp;Infinity War and&nbsp;Endgame cost over $300 million, according to&nbsp;List Fist. However, films like&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok and&nbsp;Spider-Man: Homecoming have cost less than $200 million to make. This means that these shows are going to have a budget near some MCU films that made a fortune at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These MCU shows are going to look to tap into Disney’s massive following, but more importantly, they will also be doing their best to add more subscribers over time. This could be a massive win for Disney if these shows are good.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Which MCU Actress Almost Played Wonder Woman For DC?</a></span></p><p>So, while $200 million seems excessive for the MCU shows, Disney could be setting themselves up for an incredible amount of long-term success.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Is MCU Star Hannah John-Kamen, And How Much Is She Worth?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmm6KrnprGbrXSZqqpnZ6Ztq%2BzjK6nZqyfYn9xfIymoKWkmaS7brLOq2SwmZ6Zrre10qKmp2c%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fheres-why-disney-is-spending-up-to-200-million-for-wandavision.html&text=Here%27s%20Why%20Disney%20Is%20Spending%20Up%20To%20%24200%20Million%20For%20WandaVision&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fheres-why-disney-is-spending-up-to-200-million-for-wandavision.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fheres-why-disney-is-spending-up-to-200-million-for-wandavision.html&title=Here%27s%20Why%20Disney%20Is%20Spending%20Up%20To%20%24200%20Million%20For%20WandaVision" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fheres-why-disney-is-spending-up-to-200-million-for-wandavision.html&title=Here%27s%20Why%20Disney%20Is%20Spending%20Up%20To%20%24200%20Million%20For%20WandaVision" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fheres-why-disney-is-spending-up-to-200-million-for-wandavision.html&title=Here%27s%20Why%20Disney%20Is%20Spending%20Up%20To%20%24200%20Million%20For%20WandaVision" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fheres-why-disney-is-spending-up-to-200-million-for-wandavision.html&description=Here%27s%20Why%20Disney%20Is%20Spending%20Up%20To%20%24200%20Million%20For%20WandaVision" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-bachelors-chantal-obrien-high-school-prom-photo-with-singer-nic-newsham.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Bachelors Chantal OBrien high school prom photo with singer Nic Newsham">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./frank-bruno-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Frank Bruno Net Worth | TheRichest">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

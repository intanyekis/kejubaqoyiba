Did he give you a reason behind their decision?</strong> "I like to keep it real! No, he didn’t, but everything happens for a reason. I’m excited for what’s to come next!"In a matter of months in quarantine, she moved into a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">beautiful Encino home</a> and gave birth to her daughter Dove. She's already manifested what's to come next, and that's not even including her goals vision board that she keeps under wraps. <span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Exclusive: Teddi Mellencamp Reveals She's Working On An ALL IN TV Show</a></span> <strong>What’s your opinion on other Housewives when they claim they decided to leave?</strong> "I would venture to guess 98% of them are playing loose with reality."She may have gotten an unruly amount of heat for being "boring" on the show, but he life is anything but.

Does it make you feel like you couldn’t win with the audience?</strong> "You know, I went into things just reacting authentically. You can’t gauge how the audience will react. So it is what it is. But those tweets can be brutal!"While keyboard warriors way feel a vindictive kind of satisfaction after posting a cruel tweet, Mellencamp has fostered a mindset that blocks out that negativity. She's proud of her surf town beach house, which she still has, and her ability to stay true to herself throughout the show.[EMBED_INSTA]https://www.instagram.com/p/CNILVDLhKlk/[/EMBED_INSTA] <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <strong>Do you think the overemphasis on glam squads was harmful? Both shaming women for using them and shaming those who didn’t care for them?</strong> "I think whatever makes someone happy is how they should approach things. Whatever everybody else thinks is white noise."<p>She doesn't take a strong stance when it comes to glam squads. While they were only initially used for special events on&nbsp;Real Housewives, she noted that soon enough the women were hiring them for everything.

According to the <i>Spectator</i>, the airport has two 24-hour free movie theaters, a waterfall, gaming consoles, a butterfly garden, and, of course, high-end duty free shopping. Furthermore, the staff also offers free tours of Singapore for passengers with a layover longer than six hours. This airport is the picture of glamour. Sounds like you could just stay at the airport for your whole trip and be totally entertained!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>References: moneyinc.com, thefiscaltimes.com, independent.co.uk, spectator.co.uk, telegraph.co.uk, worldtravelguide.com, wikivoyage.com, gulfnews.com, stuff.co.nz, thepointsguy.com, internationalairportreview.com, coloradospringsgazette.com, waytogo.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmraqRq7Kte5FuZKano6l6rcHXrqmip6WoeqK10ammq6yjYrOzu8xmmKWkXZa%2FsMHNnWStoJVixLC%2By51m</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f25-most-luxurious-airports-from-all-around-the-world.html&text=25%20Most%20Luxurious%20Airports%20From%20All%20Around%20The%20World&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f25-most-luxurious-airports-from-all-around-the-world.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f25-most-luxurious-airports-from-all-around-the-world.html&title=25%20Most%20Luxurious%20Airports%20From%20All%20Around%20The%20World" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f25-most-luxurious-airports-from-all-around-the-world.html&title=25%20Most%20Luxurious%20Airports%20From%20All%20Around%20The%20World" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f25-most-luxurious-airports-from-all-around-the-world.html&title=25%20Most%20Luxurious%20Airports%20From%20All%20Around%20The%20World" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f25-most-luxurious-airports-from-all-around-the-world.html&description=25%20Most%20Luxurious%20Airports%20From%20All%20Around%20The%20World" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./grant-gustin.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Grant Gustin Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-are-ginger-gonzaga-parents-and-family-tree.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Are Adele L And Christopher Deipirine Gonzaga?

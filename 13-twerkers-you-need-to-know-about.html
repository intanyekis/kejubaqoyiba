Wear tight clothing, boys will watch. Wear even less clothing and a whole bunch of boys will watch. And the hotter the girl is, the more attention they will get. We can call it the Kim Kardashian disease. It’s a narcissistic impulse that drives a young woman to display her body like a piece of meat on a Mexican street corner and then invite the entire world to watch. And like a good cut sirloin, it works.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's how twerking became part of our vernacular. A young woman sticks her butt up into the air in a sexual manner and begins to shake and gyrate it. The rules are pretty much open for interpretation, but if you are hot, wear tight or little clothing (they always say less is more) and shake your rump like you don’t care, then you are pretty much well on your way. The visual display can be a hit or end in a drunken thud when an intoxicated collegiate hits the deck hard after losing her balance. Either way, twerking has caught on like beer pong at college parties and beyond. It is a mainstay until the next gratuitous dance craze arrives. These are 13 twerkers you gotta know.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-khristine-monroe><strong>13.

Most of Monroe’s content has been labeled with “Adult Only” and “Restricted” due to their nature and her desire to expose her favorite asset. Either way, she can twerk with the best of them out there and has earned a spot on this list.</p><p></p><h2 id=12-jessy-hitta><strong>12.

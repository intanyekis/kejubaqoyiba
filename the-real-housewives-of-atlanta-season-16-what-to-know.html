In addition to her <i>Housewives </i>homecoming, Porsha also signed an overall scripted talent deal with NBCUniversal.</p><p>“I’m incredibly thankful for the vision and faith NBCUniversal has put in me to be a larger part of their family,” she shared in a statement. “I’m looking forward to being back on <i>The Real Housewives of Atlanta</i>, and showing the world my new world!”</p><p>What makes Porsha’s return even more intriguing is that just 10 days after her big announcement, it was reported she had <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> from husband <strong>Simon Guobadia</strong> after 15 months of marriage.</p><p>Two days later, Porsha <a href=#>confirmed the news</a> via Instagram, writing, “Thank you for your prayers & support.”’</p><p>Porsha and Simon went public with their engagement in May 2021 after just one month of dating.</p><p>Their relationship was a point of contention for many of Porsha’s <i>RHOA</i> castmates, as Simon and ex-wife <strong>Falynn Guobadia</strong>, who made multiple appearances on <i>RHOA</i> with her then-husband, finalized their divorce just one month prior to Porsha and Simon revealing their relationship.</p><p>Expect Porsha’s divorce to be a major story line next season.</p><h3><b>Who Is Leaving the Cast of ‘The Real Housewives of Atlanta’?</b></h3><p>After 14 seasons on the show, Kandi <a href=#>announced her surprising departure</a> from <i>The Real Housewives of Atlanta</i> in February.</p><p>“I’m not really keeping up right now,” Kandi <a href=# rel=noopener>told <i>Variety</i></a> on the red carpet of the 2024 Grammy Awards. “I’m not keeping up. I already said it, so I’ll tell you. I decided I’m not coming back this year.”</p><p>Kandi joined <i>RHOA</i> during season 2 in 2009 and has been a mainstay ever since, even scoring her own Bravo spinoffs <i>The Kandi Factory</i>, <i>Kandi’s Wedding</i>, <i>Kandi’s Ski Trip</i> and <i>Kandi & the Gang</i>.</p><p>“It’s been 14 seasons, and they allowed us to sit around for a little too long,” the “No Scrubs” songwriter continued, “but during that time I had started working on a lot of other things, and I got some nice big projects coming soon, so I’m super excited about those things.”</p><p>In addition, Marlo <a href=#>announced she was handing in her peach</a> ahead of season 16.</p><p>“My contract with<i> Real Housewives of Atlanta</i> ended when season 15 wrapped,” Marlo told <i>Us Weekly </i>in a statement<i> </i>in February. “This break from <i>RHOA</i> is a fresh start, allowing me the space to participate in new creative entertainment projects focused on my future, and not reliving my past.”</p><p>Marlo became a full-time cast member during season 14 in 2022 after making many iconic appearances as a friend of the Housewives since season 4 in 2012.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Everything-to-Know-About-Massive-RHOA-Cast-Shake-Ups-2.jpg><p>She continued, “My nephews are transitioning into pivotal stages of their academic adolescence, and I am focused on my representation in their eyes and getting back to showing my multifaceted lifestyle of philanthropy, fashion and fabulosity.”</p><p>Meanwhile, fans have speculated that Sanya will not be returning to the cast after the former Olympian deleted any mention of the show from <a href=# rel=noopener>her Instagram bio</a>.</p><p>Sanya joined the show during season 14 in 2022. In December 2023, she welcomed her second child with husband Aaron Ross after she suffered a miscarriage earlier in the year, which was emotionally documented on <i>RHOA</i>.</p><h3><b>Is NeNe Leakes Returning to ‘The Real Housewives of Atlanta’?</b></h3><p><a href=#><strong>NeNe Leakes</strong></a>, the OG <i>Atlanta</i> star whose name is synonymous with the franchise, has long been rumored to make her return, but nothing is currently in the cards.</p><p>NeNe has had a tortured relationship with Bravo since she left <i>RHOA</i> for good after season 12 in 2020.</p><p>In April 2022, she <a href=#>sued Bravo and <strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a>, citing a hostile and racist working environment. NeNe dropped the lawsuit just four months later.</p><p>NeNe also <a href=#>made disparaging remarks</a> about Andy during an appearance on Bethenny Frankel’s <i>Just B</i> podcast in September 2023, telling Bethenny, “I don’t think he ever liked me.”</p><p>Still, fans were optimistic about NeNe potentially returning to the show in the wake of Porsha’s comeback. In February, though,<a href=# rel=noopener><i> TMZ</i> reported</a> that NeNe was not in talks to make her <i>Housewives</i> return.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3>Who Else Is Returning to ‘The Real Housewives of Atlanta’?</h3><p>Bravo has yet to make any other cast announcements for season 16, so the fates of Drew, <a href=#><strong>Shereé Whitfield</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kenya Moore</strong></a> remain unclear.</p><h3>When Does ‘The Real Housewives of Atlanta’ Season 16 Premiere?</h3><p>No premiere date has been announced, but<i> </i>season 16 is expected to debut later in 2024.</p><p>In the meantime, all 15 seasons of <i>The Real Housewives of Atlanta </i>are available to stream on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2nsqK4jKGmrquVrLa3sdJmpp9lkam5orrTmmSsnZGovK95kG9ksKCRqXq1u4ykpaivXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-real-housewives-of-atlanta-season-16-what-to-know.html&text=The%20Real%20Housewives%20of%20Atlanta%20Season%2016%3a%20What%20to%20Know&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-real-housewives-of-atlanta-season-16-what-to-know.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-real-housewives-of-atlanta-season-16-what-to-know.html&title=The%20Real%20Housewives%20of%20Atlanta%20Season%2016%3a%20What%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-real-housewives-of-atlanta-season-16-what-to-know.html&title=The%20Real%20Housewives%20of%20Atlanta%20Season%2016%3a%20What%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-real-housewives-of-atlanta-season-16-what-to-know.html&title=The%20Real%20Housewives%20of%20Atlanta%20Season%2016%3a%20What%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-real-housewives-of-atlanta-season-16-what-to-know.html&description=The%20Real%20Housewives%20of%20Atlanta%20Season%2016%3a%20What%20to%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-turkish-buisnessman-yilmaz-bektas-married-now-wedding-with-zuleyka-rivera-323967-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Turkish Buisnessman Yilmaz Bektas Married Now?

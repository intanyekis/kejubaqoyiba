She has been visiting the movie sets with him since an early age of <i>4 years old.&nbsp;</i></p><p>According to <strong>Christian</strong>, taking her to movie sets would interest her and make her appreciate the art.&nbsp;</p><p>Her father manages to spend time with her despite his busy schedule.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2013 the father and daughter were spotted climbing in <strong>Boston</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Christian was seen teaching her to <i>negotiate the frame and balance</i>. The greatest joy for him is his daughter’s happiness.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=since-his-daughter-loves-his-batman-character-he-often-does-the-batman-voice-for-her></span>Since his daughter loves his Batman character, he often does the Batman voice for her<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Emmeline Bale’s father, Christian Bale, took an Oscar for ‘The Fighter’ as he was electrifying like the classic hero Batman.&nbsp;</p><p>As per critics, he gave one of his best performances ever playing a working-class hero. Talking about his movie <strong>‘Out of the Furnace’ </strong>where he was a <strong>steelworker </strong>named Russell Beyes, searching for his brother, which pits him against a ruthless backwood crime ringleader, played by Woody Harrelson.</p><p>&nbsp;The director has called this movie a metaphor for America for everything that has happened to it in the last five years.</p><p>For the script, Christian worked in a steel mill. He said that they did correct research, and among all other reasons, one should watch this movie for Casey Affleck, who played Christian’s brother, as his work in the movie is phenomenal.</p><p>&nbsp;He further added he had the best experience working with the director. As per Christian, it was a real story of an American character and America’s changing times.&nbsp;</p><p>While preparing for this interview, the team discovered something for which they apologize to him in advance.

He had a negative impression about marriage as he grew up in a family full of failed marriages.</p><p>&nbsp;Most of his family members were divorced, so he did not have a healthy idea about marriage.</p><p>So he never wanted to get married, thinking that his marriage will also end up in divorce. But when he met his current <strong>wife, Sibi Blazic</strong>, his perception of marriage changed, and suddenly, getting married seemed like a fantastic idea for him.&nbsp;</p><p>Now the couple is happily married for over 20 years and is blessed with two gorgeous kids.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=emmeline-bale-an-award-winning-actress></span>Emmeline Bale, an award-winning actress?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>For a movie called Vice, <strong>Christian </strong>won the <i>Golden Globe award</i>.

Transformation, be it physical or mental, he has always enjoyed it.&nbsp;</p><p>He shares his experience on how it feels to lose weight. The journey that one goes through while losing weight is horrible.&nbsp;</p><p>Going to bed without having food and not socializing with anybody makes it miserable.&nbsp;</p><p>Keeping these miserable feelings aside, there’s this great sense of getting control over yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>The journey of gaining weight is the opposite. According to him, when someone is losing weight, he also loses discipline and goes around like crazy.&nbsp;</p><p>When he was asked whether he would choose <i>physical transformation </i>or prosthetics, he said that a mixture would be great because certain things cannot be achieved with prosthetics.&nbsp;</p><p>Later he talks about how far people have come in the ability to do prosthetics. For his role as <i>Dick Cheney </i>in <i>Vice</i>, he put on a lot of weight and took prosthetics.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is the video from the interview.&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth></span>Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She is born to a silver spoon.&nbsp;</p><p>Christian has a jaw-dropping net worth of <strong>$120 million</strong>, which he has accumulated through his career in acting.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-does-christian-earn-money></span>How Does Christian Earn Money?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The primary source of income is his acting.

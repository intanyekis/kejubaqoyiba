He earlier enjoyed a flourishing career in the music industry, selling more than 70 million albums worldwide.</p><p>How did an artist who was on the lead of the world plummet so far, declining in his finances after making several millions of dollars? Here we analyze his career and history and see what we found.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DMX-net-worth-2021-1024x576.jpg><h2 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading">Early years and career</h2><p>In December of 1970, DMX was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and his parents named him Earl Simmons. He is a native of Yonkers, where he was brought up after his parents relocated.</p><p>His hit single “Party Up” hit the charts in 1999, followed by “Ruff Ryders Anthem,” ‘X Gon’ Give it to Ya,” “Where the Hood At?” and What’s My Name?” He has been recognized with the release of seven studio albums, many of which sold millions of copies. DMX also performed in several movie roles, and an autobiography of the artist was also published.</p><p>He is an American Music Awards winner, and he has won five MTV Music Video Awards and three Grammy Awards nominations. He also performed in a cameo for the film “Top Five.”</p><p><strong>Related Article: </strong><a href=#>Breakup With Alex Rodriguez Will Not Affect Jennifer Lopez Net Worth</a></p><p>DMX also built up a notable following of supporters overseas. He has performed on stages worldwide, where his hip-hop style of rap has been a top preference of followers throughout the world.</p><h2 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading">Personal life and controversy</h2><p>In 1999, DMX tied the knot with Tashera Simmons. The couple married for 11 years and had four children—Xavier, Tocoma, Praise Mary Ella, and Shawn. Tashera announced their divorce in 2010.</p><p>During their marriage, DMX was not honest, and DNA testing confirmed that he fathered at least two children due to these extramarital affairs. Once DNA outcomes proved that DMX fathered Monique Wayne’s son in 2007, he was commanded to pay her $1.5 million.</p><p>DMX is actually the father of 15 children. (His youngest child, Exodus Simmons, was born to his girlfriend, Desiree Lindstrom, on August 16, 2016.)</p><p>DMX has been public about his inclination to crack cocaine. He started using the drug when he was 14 years old after he smoked a laced marijuana cigarette. He also declares to have bipolar disorder.</p><p>In 2016, he was discovered unresponsive in a Ramada Inn parking lot in Yonkers. First responders revived him, and he was given Narcan before being hurried to the hospital. Police found no illegal substances on the property. However, an eyewitness said DMX ingested some substance before collapsing. DMX said that an asthma attack caused it.</p><p>In April 2021, DMX suffered from a heart attack reportedly caused by a drug overdose that ultimately left him in a coma. Tragically, he died on April 9, 2021, at the age of 50.</p><h2 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading">Difficulties and obstructions</h2><p>Due to the large quantity of debt that the rapper has gathered, there have been limitations set in place which stop him from getting a passport, and this is going to be the case for several years.</p><p>The purpose of the bankruptcy is so DMX can restructure his debts to let him recover the right to a passport so he can visit overseas and start performing where he has an enormous fan base. This will benefit him make the income he requires to pay his debts and get back on track financially.</p><h2 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading">Legal issues</h2><p>In addition to the debt that DMX owes for child support and to multiple creditors, he was also found guilty of tax cheating of $1.7 million. He was credited with fourteen counts in 2017.</p><p>DMX was found guilty of at least some of the charges, and in March of 2018, he was sentenced to spend one year behind bars in prison for the crime of tax avoidance. He was remanded to jail, where he completed his sentence, and he was released a little early in January of 2019. At that time, his debt to the IRS was still a hefty sum which amounted to $2.3 million.</p><p>DMX is making monthly payments to the IRS, and they are garnishing his income until the debt is paid in full.</p><h2 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading">How DMX involved in this misery</h2><p>We discovered that Earl Simmons had faced a series of negative experiences from when he was a child. He was brought up to have faith, and we still observe this evidenced in his music, but he grew up in Yonkers, and while Earl was still relatively young, his father left him and his mother.</p><p>There are stories that he encountered a disorganized and violent childhood as his mother was claimed to be offensive. Earl spent a lot of time surviving to the best of his strength out on the streets and in occasional group homes. When he was a teenager, Earl had many run-ins with the law, and his life was filled with destruction.</p><p>There were also drugs and alcohol use to accuse of his dilemmas at such a young age. Earl spent time in and out of prison because of the lifestyle that he was living. Salvation came for him through his passion for hip hop. He became a DJ and then went on to rap music, where he made considerable fortunes in the rap scene.</p><h2 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading">Final thoughts</h2><p>DMX had got himself in a challenging position, but it was not difficult for him to dig himself out of this financial trouble. life had given him many chances to come out of the misery of his childhood, but he did not manage to do until he died in April 2021</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCwzLFkp52kYsSwvtOhZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdmx-net-worth.html&text=DMX%20Net%20Worth%20At%20The%20Time%20Of%20His%20Death&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdmx-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdmx-net-worth.html&title=DMX%20Net%20Worth%20At%20The%20Time%20Of%20His%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdmx-net-worth.html&title=DMX%20Net%20Worth%20At%20The%20Time%20Of%20His%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdmx-net-worth.html&title=DMX%20Net%20Worth%20At%20The%20Time%20Of%20His%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdmx-net-worth.html&description=DMX%20Net%20Worth%20At%20The%20Time%20Of%20His%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./john-fogerty-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John Fogerty Net Worth  How Much is John Worth?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dakota-gonzalez.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dakota Gonzalez">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

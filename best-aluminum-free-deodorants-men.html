What more could you ask for?</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Why should I avoid aluminum in my deodorant?</h3><p>Aluminum is found in some deodorants and particularly in products with an antiperspirant effect. They work by plugging the pores of your underarms to reduce sweating. It may be effective, but is it good for your skin? For some people, not so much. While most specific health concerns around aluminum salts in deodorant have been disproven, some people have found aluminum to cause irritation. The armpit is a particularly sensitive area with thin skin so that irritation can be an issue. That being said, everyone is different. Try shopping around and testing the effects of various deodorants to see what works for you. If you’re concerned about aluminum, this list is here to help.</p><h3>What other ingredients should I avoid in my deodorant?</h3><p>This is a difficult question to answer, as everyone’s skin is different, and people have different needs when it comes to deodorant. Ingredients like alcohol can be quite drying, which can be a problem for people with sensitive skin. Sometimes, strong artificial fragrances can also be quite sensitizing. Another good general rule is avoiding ingredients you wouldn’t want in your shampoo or skincare. For instance, if you avoid irritating sulfates and parabens, it’s probably best to make sure there are none of these in your deodorant as well.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3>What is the difference between a deodorant and an antiperspirant?</h3><p>Sometimes, these terms are used interchangeably. However, generally, antiperspirants stop sweating in the first place, while deodorants reduce the odor. The issue is that most antiperspirants use ingredients like aluminum salts to block the pores, which can irritate some people. They also can be more drying.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6OyuL%2BOm5ysrF2Wuba5yKespmWWp7KmecOepp2nopa7tb%2BMppynZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-aluminum-free-deodorants-men.html&text=The%2028%20Best%20Aluminum%20Free%20Deodorants%20for%20Men&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-aluminum-free-deodorants-men.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-aluminum-free-deodorants-men.html&title=The%2028%20Best%20Aluminum%20Free%20Deodorants%20for%20Men" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-aluminum-free-deodorants-men.html&title=The%2028%20Best%20Aluminum%20Free%20Deodorants%20for%20Men" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-aluminum-free-deodorants-men.html&title=The%2028%20Best%20Aluminum%20Free%20Deodorants%20for%20Men" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-aluminum-free-deodorants-men.html&description=The%2028%20Best%20Aluminum%20Free%20Deodorants%20for%20Men" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-emma-chamberlain-her-met-gala-look-10k-dm-youtuber-bio.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Emma Chamberlain And Why Is Everyone Obsessed With Her Met Gala Look?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./suzanne-bukinik.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Suzanne Bukinik">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

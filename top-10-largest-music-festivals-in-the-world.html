Typically their minds are drawn to the image of Woodstock and a muddy field invaded by hippies selling tie-dye shirts and grilled cheese sandwiches, among other things, out of their VW Micro Bus. Though there still are a number of festivals that are reminiscent of the 1960s counter-culture, there are many music festivals today that are nothing like it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Recently, music festivals have become an extremely popular vacation. This is probably because of the rising price of concert tickets. One can either pay between $50 and $100&nbsp;to see their favorite band at a local venue, or they can load up their camping equipment and pay the same amount or just a little bit more to go see a number of bands over the course of a weekend. The latter just seems to make more sense to the majority of music fans. The rise in popularity of these types of concerts has lead to the rise of the "major" music festival.</p><p>Music festivals occur everywhere. Most are just small-time local events that take place on someone’s land. The organizers gather up a couple of the bands they know and invite their friends for a weekend of camping and music. However, some music festivals are huge. Some draw in attendance numbers in the tens or even the hundreds of thousands. These music festivals typically started out small, but the concert promoters quickly became millionaires.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-ultra---miami-florida---330-000-attendees-in-2014><strong>10. </strong><strong>Ultra - Miami, Florida - 330,000 Attendees in 2014</strong></h2><p>Via ultramusic.com</p><p>Ultra is the biggest electronic music festival in the United States.

Last year the concert saw 360,000 fans flock through its gates.

This year they are adding Las Vegas, Nevada to this list of locations. The event was started by Insomniac Event in 1997 and hosted just over 375,000 fans last year. The addition of a fourth location in the Western United States is assured to bring in a much larger crowd this year. This festival rose out of the underground and right into the public’s eye due to the 2014 Sundance Film Festival documentary EDC 2013: Under The Electric Sky, which was based on the event.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-new-orleans-jazz-and-heritage-festival---435-000-attendees-in-2014><strong>7. </strong><strong>New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival - 435,000 Attendees in 2014</strong></h2><p>Via festivalsnobs.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival is the oldest music festival to make the list.

Not only does it attract hundreds of thousands of people, but it also brings in about $300,000 in revenue for the city annually. It is estimated over 435,000 people attended this event in 2014. “Jazz Fest” as it is often called, is scheduled to take place from April 24th to May 3rd this year.

Since its first year, it has earned itself the nickname “A Party With A Purpose.” Last year’s party was attended by over 550,000 people. It is an annual celebration of African American music, art, and culture, scheduled for July 2nd through July 5th this year.

In fact, it is the largest music festival&nbsp;held in the Western Hemisphere. Summerfest&nbsp;takes place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in Henry Maier Festival Park. Since being created&nbsp;in 1968, Summerfest has grown into a very big deal. It is referred to by bands as “The Big Gig”. The week-long event features over 700 artists ranging in popularity from some of the biggest names in the music industry to small local bands who have just begun putting out material.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The biggest draw for Summerfest is the price. Unlike many of the other major festivals like Coachella, Bonnaroo and Ultra, Summerfest is highly affordable. Last year, a day pass was only $15. Some festivals will charge an entrance fee at the gate and then charge another entrance price for shows. Not Summerfest. The lineup for this year has not been released yet, but 2014 saw artists like <a title="Joan Jett Net Worth" href=#>Joan Jett</a> and the Blackhearts, Kansas, <a title="George Thorogood Net Worth" href=#>George Thorogood</a>, and <a title="Ziggy Marley Net Worth" href=#>Ziggy Marley</a> grace the stage.

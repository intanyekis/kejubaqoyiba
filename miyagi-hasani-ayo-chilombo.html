Let's get to know as we explore his life details.&nbsp;</p><h2>How Did Miyagi Hasani Ayo Chilombo Die?</h2><p>Miyagi Hasani Ayo Chilombo died on <i>July 19, 2012</i>, in Los Angeles, California, United States. He lost his two years of battle to a brain tumor.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2024/1/16/Miyagi%20Hasani%20Ayo%20Chilombo%20and%20Jhen%C3%A9%20Aiko%20were%20closest%20siblings-1705426800726.jpg><p>Chilombo was diagnosed with cancer in 2010. His world was shaken upon hearing this news. Despite his illness, he tried his best to always be in good spirits and turned to Buddhism.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, at the age of 26, Miyagi left the world. He was buried in the cemetery of West Burbank Blvd, Burbank, located in California.</p><h3>Miyagi Hasani Ayo Chilombo's Love Life Prior To Death</h3><p>Have you ever wondered about the love life of Jhené Aiko's late brother? Miyagi Hasani Ayo Chilombo was successful enough to hide his romantic life from the public eye.</p><p>There are no details of Chilombo's dating life or girlfriends. So, it is safe to say, that Miyagi was not dating anyone at the time of death.</p><h2>Miyagi Hasani Ayo Chilombo's Death Affected Family&nbsp;</h2><p>The tragic passing of Miyagi Hasani deeply affected his family. His sister, Jhené Aiko, has talked about the grief she endured during the time of Chilombo's death. She said;</p><p><i>I was in limbo. On one hand, I got to do so many things. But on the other, my brother, who I was the closest person to, wasn't there to experience it with me. He would've been on tour with me. He probably would've been DJing my sets. Mentally, I was lost</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2024/1/16/Jhen%C3%A9%20Aiko%20made%20a%20tattoo%20of%20her%20Miyagi%20Ayo%20Hasani%20Chilombo's%20name%20on%20her%20left%20collarbone-1705427352624.jpg"><p>Coincidentally, when Chilombo died Aiko's career as singer was beginning to take a pace. She had so much to do, however, due to her brother's demise, Jhené, was mentally broken.</p><p>Aiko further revealed that she decided to stay away from the things connected with her brother. But, she did not succeed in forgetting about her brother's loss.</p><h2>Jhené Aiko Tribute To Chilombo</h2><p>Jhené Aiko talked about the dark moments and emotional turmoil she went through. She decided to express her grief in words and make a tribute to her late brother.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>Aiko made a song titled <i>For My Brother </i>in the memory of Miyagi Hasani Ayo. The lyrics of the song convey the emotions of grief and the struggle to come to terms with the impending loss, as well as the hope for recovery.</p><p>Initially, the songstress did not want to release the song publicly. But, Aiko made the song public later for people to know about her brother's hard life.</p><p>Not only song, but Jhené has <a href=# rel=nofollow>dedicated a tattoo</a> for her late brother. With red ink, she has written "Miyagi Hasani Ayo Chilombo" on her left collarbone.</p><h2>Let's Look At Miyagi Hasani Ayo's Early Life</h2><p>The late Miyagi Hasani Ayo was born in Los Angeles, California, on <i>July 7, 1986</i>.

His parents were married for 20 years before their separation in 2000. Christina's divorce from Karamo was finalized in 2019.</p><p>Growing up in a musically inclined family, the celebrity brother loved music. Jhené and Miyagi often dreamt of being a great musician in the future.</p><p>Unfortunately, Chilombo's early life is not documented well. His educational background and childhood have not been discussed in public.</p><h2>Chilombo's Blended Family</h2><p>Following the divorce of Miyagi's father, Dr Karamo, he re-married and <a href=# rel=nofollow>has five children</a> including Moron, Dia, and Kareena. So, besides his 4 siblings, the late Chilombo has an additional three half-sisters and two half-brothers.</p><p>Miyagi's siblings are Miyoko, Jamila, Jhené, and Jahi with whom he spent the majority of his childhood.

He was born on July 4, 1984, and is the first son of their parents. Like his other siblings, Jahi is also a lover of music and is thriving in his career as a disc jockey.</p><h3>Jhené Aiko Efuru Chilombo</h3><p>Born on <i>March 16, 1988, </i>Jhené Aiko is a singer. After marketers and promoters at Sony and Epic Records claimed that she was rapper Lil’ Fizz’s sister, she was thrust into the limelight. She has won two awards for her hard work in music.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2024/1/16/Jhen%C3%A9%20Aiko%20in%20a%20black%20outfit%20taking%20a%20selfie-1705427448678.jpg><p>Aiko was married to the record producer <strong>Dot Da Genius </strong>in 2014, but they separated in 2016.

His sister, Jhené, wished to go on a world tour and perform in various places with Miyagi as a DJ.</p><p>Alas, that wish did not come to be fulfilled. Prior to death, Aiko's late brother was a media personality, and not much was disclosed about his professional life.</p><p>So, Miyagi's net worth at the time of his death is undisclosed. Nevertheless, he was born to a well-to-do family with his father as a pediatrician. His siblings Jhené Aiko and Mila J are millionaires now with a net worth of <strong>$6 Million</strong> and <strong>$4 Million</strong> respectively.</p><p>For more interesting bio and gossip, Visit <strong>MARRIEDCELEB</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqagspmXnnqprdKapaJlka68bq%2FHoqOopZKk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmiyagi-hasani-ayo-chilombo.html&text=Mila%20J%20and%20Jhen%20Aiko%27s%20Late%20Brother%2c%20Death%2c%20Buddhism&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmiyagi-hasani-ayo-chilombo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmiyagi-hasani-ayo-chilombo.html&title=Mila%20J%20and%20Jhen%20Aiko%27s%20Late%20Brother%2c%20Death%2c%20Buddhism" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmiyagi-hasani-ayo-chilombo.html&title=Mila%20J%20and%20Jhen%20Aiko%27s%20Late%20Brother%2c%20Death%2c%20Buddhism" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmiyagi-hasani-ayo-chilombo.html&title=Mila%20J%20and%20Jhen%20Aiko%27s%20Late%20Brother%2c%20Death%2c%20Buddhism" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmiyagi-hasani-ayo-chilombo.html&description=Mila%20J%20and%20Jhen%20Aiko%27s%20Late%20Brother%2c%20Death%2c%20Buddhism" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./actors-who-came-from-acting-school-who-never-needed-an-acting-class.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="5 Actors Who Came From Acting School (&amp;amp; 5 Who Never Needed An Acting Class)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./meghan-heffern-net-worth-dating-boyfriend-breakup-wiki.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meghan Heffern Net Worth, Earnings, Dating, Boyfriend, Breakpu, Wiki-Bio">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

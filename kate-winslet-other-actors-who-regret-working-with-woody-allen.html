It’s fucking disgraceful. And I have to take responsibility for the fact that I worked with them both," Kate shared with Vanity Fair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selena-gomez---39-a-rainy-day-in-new-york-39><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Selena Gomez - 'A Rainy Day In New York'</span></h2><p>Selena Gomez has remained relatively unproblematic for most of her career!

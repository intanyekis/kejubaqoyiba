Though given its enormous fanbase, it is hard to get anything past 'Friends' viewers. <span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The One 'Friends' Episode Matthew Perry Refused To Film</a></span>Yet another moment similar to Rachel's took place during season 8 between Phoebe and Monica. While the two are having a conversation about Tim at the coffee house, a fan couldn't help but notice Monica looking a little different for a split second. Let's take a look back and see how it all played out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=was-monica-really-replace-by-a-filler-on-friends>Was Monica Really Replace By A Filler On 'Friends'?</h2><p>You really can't get anything passed hardcore 'Friends' fans. They're on top of things and that includes even the most minor switches, like in season, when Rachel was wearing no necklace at one point, but then suddenly, she's wearing one.</p><p>That was far from the only odd moment, during season five, Matt LeBlanc oddly changes outfits while he's at Ross' apartment building... we even see Joey at Monica's holding bottles in his left hand, only to replaced by cans when the scene cuts back to him.</p><ul><li><strong>Some of these errors typically take place because of reshoots during certain scenes.</strong></li></ul><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Who Was Courteney Cox's Favorite Guest-Star Love Interest On 'Friends'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There were several more of these types of moments throughout the show's lengthy ten-year run. Heck, even in the final episode of the series, fans noticed the same extras at different airports...</p><p>Perhaps the most shocking of them all deals with extras stepping in for the characters on the show. That took place on multiple occasions with both Rachel and Monica.</p><p>We'll take a look at which episode featured fake Monica and how the fans was able to spot the moment - one lots of fans missed.</p><h2 id=courteney-cox-likely-doesn-t-remember-the-moment-herself>Courteney Cox Likely Doesn't Remember The Moment Herself</h2><p>Turns out, <a href=#>Courteney Cox doesn't have the greatest memory when it comes to the show</a>. During the reunion, the sitcom star admitted she had forgotten about a lot of the moments that took place on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I should’ve watched all 10 seasons because when I did the reunion and was asked questions, I was like, ‘I don’t remember being there,'” she said.</p><p>I don’t remember filming so many episodes. I see it on TV sometimes and I stop and go, ‘Oh my god, I don’t remember this at all.’ But it’s so funny,” she added.</p><ul><li><strong>Despite 'Friends' coming to an end, Courteney Cox and the rest of the cast will continue to cash-in for a very long time, making a cool $20 million per year off reruns, merchandise and residuals.</strong></li></ul><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>This Is Why Courteney Cox Can’t Remember Filming ‘Friends’</a></span></p><p>In fairness, Cox did reveal that she doesn't have the greatest memory, hardly remembering anything from her childhood. Though despite the fact that she doesn't remember much from the iconic sitcom, it doesn't take away on its impact.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It doesn’t matter what generation is watching it. It holds up,” se said. “I think the comedy is relevant,” she explained. “People can relate to every character. I don’t care how big the cell phone is. The computer you can’t lift. Life is that way.”</p><p>Hopefully for Cox, fans don't have a great memory either, especially when it comes to this awkward moment.</p><h2 id=the-replacement-took-place-in-the-one-with-rachel-s-date-in-season-8>The Replacement Took Place In 'The One With Rachel's Date' In Season 8</h2><p>The moment took place in season eight during the episode, 'The One With Rachel's Date'. The storyline between Monica and Phoebe saw the two battling it out over Tim... but not in a good way. Phoebe wanted to break up with him while Monica wanted to fire him - the two were at the coffee house discussing who would break the news first.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was on TikTok that a fan would notice something strange with Monica during the scene.</p><p>"I know there is so many mistakes in Friends but I have never seen this one before."</p><p>"So I've been watching Friends, and this is the episode where Phoebe is dating Monica's sous chef. And I just noticed this little blunder. That's not Monica, that's not Monica!"</p><p>A great eye by the 'Friends' fans and in truth, it is a moment very few fans caught. It'll be interesting to see in the future which other blunder production moments fans missed. Without a doubt, the 'Friends' army is on it as we speak.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>This Is Why Lisa Kudrow Can’t Remember Filming ‘Friends’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidq6GVo7G0ecGisZqqopp6rrXSrZiknV2strW0jKamp6GTlnqzsc%2BlmJydnZq7tXs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffriends-bizarre-mistake-with-monica-replacement.html&text=%27Friends%27%20Fans%20Caught%20Someone%20Else%20As%20Monica%20During%20This%20Scene&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffriends-bizarre-mistake-with-monica-replacement.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffriends-bizarre-mistake-with-monica-replacement.html&title=%27Friends%27%20Fans%20Caught%20Someone%20Else%20As%20Monica%20During%20This%20Scene" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffriends-bizarre-mistake-with-monica-replacement.html&title=%27Friends%27%20Fans%20Caught%20Someone%20Else%20As%20Monica%20During%20This%20Scene" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffriends-bizarre-mistake-with-monica-replacement.html&title=%27Friends%27%20Fans%20Caught%20Someone%20Else%20As%20Monica%20During%20This%20Scene" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffriends-bizarre-mistake-with-monica-replacement.html&description=%27Friends%27%20Fans%20Caught%20Someone%20Else%20As%20Monica%20During%20This%20Scene" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-celebs-who-got-trapped-by-their-significant-others.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Celebs Who Were &amp;quot;Tricked&amp;quot; By Their Significant Others">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kimbo-slice-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Unraveling The Net Worth Of Kimbo Slice: The Journey Of A Legendary Fighter">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

And, on another matter of offseason business, the Blue Jays picked up the two-year, $21 million club option on reliever <a class=ath_autolink data-id=WsZutc3ZuoWWwHv4 href=#>Chad Green</a>.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The QO is a one-year contract worth the mean salary of <a class=ath_autolink data-id=4 href=#>MLB</a>‚Äôs 125 highest-paid players and can be offered to free agents who have never received it before and who spent their entire season on the offering team‚Äôs roster.</p><p>If Chapman accepts the offer, he will remain with the Blue Jays for the 2024 season. If he declines the offer and signs elsewhere, the Blue Jays will receive a compensation draft pick. Because the Blue Jays went over the competitive balance tax threshold in 2023, their additional draft pick would come after the conclusion of the fourth round.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>ROSTER MOVES:</p><p>üîπ We've acquired LHP Brendon Little from the Cubs in exchange for cash considerations. He has been selected to the 40-man roster</p><p>üîπ RHP Mitch White selected to the 40-man roster</p><p>üîπ 3B Matt Chapman extended a Qualifying Offer <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/u6FciGeoCy</a></p><p>‚Äî Toronto Blue Jays (@BlueJays) <a href=#>November 6, 2023</a></p><p>Chapman has until Nov. 14 at 4 p.m. ET to either accept or decline the offer ‚Äî but the most likely outcome is that he will decline it and test free agency.</p><p>While Chapman‚Äôs 2023 season was uneven offensively, with an outstanding April helping to prop up his overall season numbers, the 30-year-old third baseman remains elite defensively ‚Äî he won his fourth Gold Glove on Sunday ‚Äî and is one of the top free agents available this winter in what‚Äôs been deemed a weak position player market. <a href=# rel=noopener>Indeed, The Athletic ranked Chapman</a> as the eighth-best free agent overall and third-best position player behind Shohei Ohtani and Cody Bellinger.</p><p>In addition to being well-placed in a shallow market, Chapman is represented by agent Scott Boras, who is known for finding lucrative deals for his clients. For a player, the downside of declining a QO, however, is that it attaches a draft-pick penalty to a player‚Äôs signing. Being forced to forfeit a draft pick to sign a particular free agent can act as a deterrent for some teams.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Even with a draft penalty attached to him, Chapman should be positioned well to receive a valuable longer-term deal. The Athletic‚Äôs <a href=# rel=noopener>Tim Britton projected a five-year, $95-million deal for Chapman</a>. His best potential fits include the reigning NL champion <a class=ath_autolink data-id=93 href=#>Arizona Diamondbacks</a>, the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=97 href=#>Chicago Cubs</a>, the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=102 href=#>Detroit Tigers</a>, the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=117 href=#>San Francisco Giants</a> or returning to the Blue Jays, where Chapman put up a .756 OPS over the past two seasons.</p><p>For the Blue Jays, it‚Äôs a smart decision to extend Chapman the QO because it protects them from a scenario where he walks away and they get nothing back. If the expected outcome unfolds and Chapman indeed declines the offer, the third baseman could still re-sign with the Blue Jays on a separate deal. But if he signs with another club, the Blue Jays at least gain the extra draft pick.</p><p>Chapman‚Äôs free-agent case is interesting. On the one hand, at the plate he still sports elite exit velocity numbers and the overall strength is there, but he has a lot of swing-and-miss in his game, despite a fairly discerning approach. This past season, after posting a monster 1.152 OPS in April, he batted .205 with a .659 OPS in 113 games after May 1, a concerning in-season drop-off. Chapman also hasn‚Äôt posted a season-ending OPS over .800 since 2020. His play at third remains excellent, however, and he makes up a lot of overall value on the defensive end. As long as he keeps putting up above-average numbers at third base, he‚Äôs a valuable everyday player even if he‚Äôs not posting a high batting average or on-base percentage.</p><p>But the Blue Jays will need to decide if they want to bring back Chapman, who is well-liked in the clubhouse, in the hopes he can find more consistency at the plate or whether they‚Äôre better off allocating the near $100 million or so it might take to sign him elsewhere ‚Äî such as to a right-handed bat with power or to a corner outfielder.</p><p>If Chapman moves on from the Blue Jays, it‚Äôll create a gaping hole at the hot corner. The Blue Jays don‚Äôt have a ready-made third base replacement, with their internal options ranging from utility guys like <a class=ath_autolink data-id=3URRhfoAzgO8ZsmW href=#>Cavan Biggio</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=NdTDgwFS4pKtmVFW href=#>Santiago Espinal</a> to the young <a class=ath_autolink data-id=20dZ9bcBIbBtuM2M href=#>Davis Schneider</a> or prospects like <a class=ath_autolink data-id=BpjIu1SI0jGt9MZX href=#>Addison Barger</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=NleDIWNA9bibSLIG href=#>Orelvis Martinez</a>, neither of whom has played in the major leagues. It would be an especially tough assignment to task a rookie to replace Chapman and none of the other players listed appear to be ideal 162-game solutions.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>There is realistically no replacing Chapman‚Äôs stellar defence, so the Blue Jays in all likelihood will take a step back defensively on the left side of the infield, but signing someone like free agent Jeimer Candelario is a decent alternative, while a veteran like Justin Turner could serve as a stop-gap solution for 2024 before one of Barger or Martinez potentially emerges as an everyday candidate in 2025.</p><p>In another bit of offseason maneuvering, the Blue Jays exercised their two-year conditional club option on Green, which will pay him $21 million and keep the right-hander in their bullpen for the 2024 and 2025 seasons.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>ROSTER UPDATE:</p><p>üîπ We've exercised our two-year conditional club option on RHP Chad Green for the 2024 and 2025 seasons <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Ji6661knTr</a></p><p>‚Äî Toronto Blue Jays (@BlueJays) <a href=#>November 6, 2023</a></p><p>The right-handed reliever, who returned from Tommy John surgery in September and pitched only 12 innings in 2023, signed a complicated contract with the Blue Jays last offseason. It included a three-year, $27 million club option that the team declined. Green then had a one-year, $6.5 million player option, which he also declined. The Blue Jays then had a final two-year, $21 million club option, which they picked up.</p><p>At $10.5 million per year, the two-year pact pays Green the highest annual average value of the three options, but it‚Äôs also a two-year commitment for a 32-year-old reliever who is only a year removed from major surgery, a term the team is likely most comfortable with.</p><p>Green looks like he can be a central piece to Toronto‚Äôs bullpen over the next couple of seasons. His 5.25 ERA this season was inflated because of an ugly first outing against the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=101 href=#>Colorado Rockies</a>, but he was largely effective in a set-up role while his peripheral numbers were promising, including a 30.8 percent strikeout rate, a 7.7 percent walk rate and a 95 mph average fastball velocity that‚Äôs in line with recent career norms.</p><p>In two more minor transactions Monday, the Blue Jays acquired left-handed pitcher <a class=ath_autolink data-id=T5bpRWcJDfuUNuis href=#>Brendon Little</a> from the Cubs for cash. Little was added to the 40-man roster, as was right-handed pitcher <a class=ath_autolink data-id=HNgFujK1s2UPEZAZ href=#>Mitch White</a>. The GM meetings begin Tuesday in Scottsdale, Ariz., which may bring more offseason moves for the Blue Jays.</p><p>(Photo of Chapman: Eric Christian Smith / Associated Press)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57lGlqcG1oZnxzfJFsZmppX2WDcMDOq6anrJ9ir63BxGahmrGjYrqiwNNmmqGZoKKur3nQrpiloZautq%2BzjKidn52iYrCprcNmnqudlaN6sLzToqanZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftoronto-blue-jays-matt-chapman-qualifying-offer-chad-green-option.html&text=Blue%20Jays%20extend%20qualifying%20offer%20to%20Matt%20Chapman%2c%20pick%20up%20two-year%20option%20for%20Chad%20Green&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftoronto-blue-jays-matt-chapman-qualifying-offer-chad-green-option.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftoronto-blue-jays-matt-chapman-qualifying-offer-chad-green-option.html&title=Blue%20Jays%20extend%20qualifying%20offer%20to%20Matt%20Chapman%2c%20pick%20up%20two-year%20option%20for%20Chad%20Green" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftoronto-blue-jays-matt-chapman-qualifying-offer-chad-green-option.html&title=Blue%20Jays%20extend%20qualifying%20offer%20to%20Matt%20Chapman%2c%20pick%20up%20two-year%20option%20for%20Chad%20Green" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftoronto-blue-jays-matt-chapman-qualifying-offer-chad-green-option.html&title=Blue%20Jays%20extend%20qualifying%20offer%20to%20Matt%20Chapman%2c%20pick%20up%20two-year%20option%20for%20Chad%20Green" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftoronto-blue-jays-matt-chapman-qualifying-offer-chad-green-option.html&description=Blue%20Jays%20extend%20qualifying%20offer%20to%20Matt%20Chapman%2c%20pick%20up%20two-year%20option%20for%20Chad%20Green" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./john-staluppi-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John Staluppi Net Worth  How Much is Staluppi Worth?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./beef-flomix.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Beef Flomix | Flo Milli Lyrics, Meaning &amp;amp; Videos">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

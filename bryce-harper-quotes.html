I hear it all the time. ‘Overrated.’ ‘You suck.’ I’ll just do something to shut them up, like, ‘I’ll show you.’”― <a href=#>Bryce Harper</a></p><p>“Baseball players have such a bad rap of, like, ‘We don’t work out, or we’re not strong or this or that.’ Guys work so hard in baseball; it’s incredible. But people don’t know that.”― <a href=#>Bryce Harper</a></p><p>“I eat ice cream all the time.”― <a href=#>Bryce Harper</a></p><p>“You don’t ever want to go out there and not be the best. You want to be the best cop that you can. Be the best writer you can be. Everybody has their goals. Everybody has their dreams.”― Bryce Harper</p><p>“I’d rather be a good person off the field than a good baseball player on the field.”― Bryce Harper</p><p>“The full thing is God-given. I don’t know how I got my swing or what I did. I know I worked every single day. I know I did as much as I could with my dad. But I never really looked at anything mechanical. There was nothing really like, ‘Oh, put your hands here.’ It was, ‘Where are you comfortable? You’re comfortable here; hit from there.’”― Bryce Harper</p><p>“Spirituality is something that makes you who you are on and off the field. It’s something you try and live by. The way you play is one thing, but the way you act is a little different. You’re just trying to be a good person, the best you can be, on and off the field.”― Bryce Harper</p><p>“I really want to have a possibility of going into the Hall of Fame one day. I think that’s huge with a lot of baseball writers and old school guys. Of course, that’s not the main goal – the main goal is winning a World Series. Hall of Fame is so far away. It’s just something I’ve always thought about doing. I want to be as clean as I can.”― <a href=#>Bryce Harper</a></p><p><strong>9th of 48 Bryce Harper Quotes</strong></p><p>“I can squat 405.

I would not take anything back at all. Everything about it was great. I got to go to places, meet people, play baseball against older kids, and better competition. I had a great time.”― Bryce Harper</p><p>“I always wanted to be a major-league baseball player.”― Bryce Harper</p><p>“If you don’t have dreams, you don’t have a life.”― <a href=#>Bryce Harper</a></p><p>“I want my teammates to know I have their backs.”― <a href=#>Bryce Harper</a></p><p>“I don’t wish that I was playing football. I love baseball, and the way I play it like it’s my last day ever playing it. I do like football, but you’ve got to respect that it’s not like baseball.”― Bryce Harper</p><p>“Staying healthy puts good numbers up. If you stay healthy and try to do the things that you can to win ballgames and do what you can for your team, that’s all that matters.”― Bryce Harper</p><p>“If I had to describe myself in one word, ‘Hercules.’”― <a href=#>Bryce Harper</a></p><p>“Baseball needs more superstars.”― <a href=#>Bryce Harper</a></p><p><strong><a href=#>Top 10 Lou Gehrig Quotes</a></strong></p><p>“D.C. fans, I think, are so good. They just come up to me, and they’re so nice and so polite and just, ‘Hey, I hope you have a great career,’ and ‘How are you doing, everything’s good?’ That’s pretty much where they leave it at.”― <a href=#>Bryce Harper</a></p><p>“My dad, he worked rebar, an ironworker.

I have enough speed and enough reaction to know where the ball goes off the bat.”― Bryce Harper</p><p>“I’ve always talked to the media. I’m pretty respectful to the media.”― <a href=#>Bryce Harper</a></p><p>“I think you have to be respectful to the people who want to talk to you.”― <a href=#>Bryce Harper</a></p><p>“I went to school, but nobody really noticed me. I just came to school, didn’t dress up or anything – just a ghost. I just worked out and went out to the field and went the baseball route. That’s how I’ve always been my whole life.”― <a href=#>Bryce Harper</a></p><p><strong>28th of 48 Bryce Harper Quotes</strong></p><p>“I know more about UFC than the wrestling circuit. I think everybody’s a pretty good guy in the UFC.”― Bryce Harper</p><p>“My body feels pretty unbelievable.”― Bryce Harper</p><p>“Sleep is huge. That’s your biggest way of recovering.

I want to ram it down your throat, put you into left field when I’m going into second base.”― Bryce Harper</p><p>“Playing football, I’m getting chills just thinking about it. That first knock of the game, you are going on kickoff, and you are just trying to smack somebody just as hard as you can. That’s how I play baseball. I want to hit you.”― <a href=#>Bryce Harper</a></p><p>“There’s nobody as sexy as Robinson Cano in the box. I had a coach, Chris Sheff, who always told me to be as sexy as you can in the box.”― Bryce Harper</p><p>“It’s not like I’m out eating McDonald’s and Del Taco every night. I eat good: my mom fixes dinner every single night – baked chicken, fish – she cooks a great meal every single night.”― Bryce Harper</p><p>“I love working hard; I think people know that.”― Bryce Harper</p><p>“It’s funny to me because everyone says I’m injury prone. That’s hilarious to me because I’ve never blown a hammy or a shoulder or anything like that, knock on wood.”― <a href=#>Bryce Harper</a></p><p>“When you hit a three-run triple, do you really need to get on third base, or do you need to stand on the double?

My body is my temple, and I’ve always thought that.”― Bryce Harper</p><p>“I can’t just go to McDonald’s after I’m done working out.

I’m really going to work hard every single day.”― <a href=#>Bryce Harper</a></p><p>“I love to train. Always have.”― <a href=#>Bryce Harper</a></p><p><strong>46th of 48 Bryce Harper Quotes</strong></p><p>“I was probably 12 or 13 when I started doing pushups, situps, dips.”― Bryce Harper</p><p>“I like eating the right way, doing things the right way. I never had to have my dad come and say, ‘Hey, you have to get back to the gym’ or, ‘Hey, you’re eating wrong.’”― <a href=#>Bryce Harper</a></p><p>“I want to get on base every single time I get up there. Whether it’s a walk or a base hit, I really don’t care how I want to get on base. I just want to be on.”― <a href=#>Bryce Harper</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCu0bKanmWYlr%2BxsdFmqK6npJrAcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbryce-harper-quotes.html&text=Top%2048%20Bryce%20Harper%20Quotes&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbryce-harper-quotes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbryce-harper-quotes.html&title=Top%2048%20Bryce%20Harper%20Quotes" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbryce-harper-quotes.html&title=Top%2048%20Bryce%20Harper%20Quotes" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbryce-harper-quotes.html&title=Top%2048%20Bryce%20Harper%20Quotes" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbryce-harper-quotes.html&description=Top%2048%20Bryce%20Harper%20Quotes" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-jaylen-browns-religion-is-the-basketball-star-muslim-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is Jaylen Browns Religion  Is The Basketball Star Muslim?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./408214-man-meets-his-long-lost-love-at-the-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Man Meets His Long-Lost Love at the Airport after 60 Years Apart, Drops to His Knees Crying &amp;amp; Propos">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

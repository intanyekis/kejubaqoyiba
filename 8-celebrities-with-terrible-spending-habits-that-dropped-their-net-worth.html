Songs like Walk on By, I'll Never Love This Way Again, and That's What Friends Are For are songs that prove why she was so successful. With all that success, you know she was making bank! Despite her hundreds of millions of album sales, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Warwick's fortune dwindled to less than one thousand dollars in 2013.</a> She blames it on her shopping addiction and poor financial management skills.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-tucker><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Chris Tucker</span></h2><p>Chris Tucker is well known for his role as a comedian and actor.

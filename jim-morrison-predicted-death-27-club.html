Morrison, who was affectionately known as the Lizard King, was a showman, poet, artist, and rebel. The legendary performer exuberated youthfulness and defined the era in which he became famous.</p><p>Morrison passed away in July 1971. Similar to other rock legends of his time, the singer died at only 27 years old. Morrison reportedly thought about death a lot and was spiritual in nature. Eerily, he even predicted that he would pass away young.</p><h2 id=how-did-jim-morrison-predict-his-own-passing>How Did Jim Morrison Predict His Own Passing?</h2><p>Jim Morrison was well aware of the fates of his peers. The rock icon, who sang lead on rock 'n' roll staples such as "Light My Fire" and "Touch Me", knew of the infamous 27 Club (though its naming came later). Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin died prematurely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Far Out, Morrison enjoyed a night out with a few friends in the fall of 1970. The singer, who shared a friendship with Joplin, was still in the mourning process. More so, Morrison was doing what he often did. He was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reflecting on life and death.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/the-doors-album-covers-deposit.jpg><p>On this fateful evening, Morrison allegedly said: <strong>"You're drinking with number three. That's right, number three." </strong>The performer, who lived a hard lifestyle, perhaps knew the odds were not in his favor. He saw how fame took a fatal toll on Hendrix and Joplin.</p><p><strong>Morrison's prophesy rang true on July 3rd, 1971</strong>, when the iconic entertainer was found lifeless in Paris, France. According to All Things Interesting, Morrison's cause of death was heart failure and no autopsy was performed. Due to the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> mysteriousness surrounding Morrison's passing</a>, multiple conspiracy theories have emerged.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What is even more eerie is that Morrison was not the only famous singer of his era to predict their demise. Even <a href=#>Jimi Hendrix himself</a> predicted his passing on multiple occasions. Lynyrd Skynyrd leader, Ronnie Van Zant, also predicted his death, claiming that he <a href=#>would not make his 30th birthday</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/james-morrison-grave-paris-france-deposit.jpg><p>Morrison was laid to rest in Paris, France at the Père Lachaise Cemetery. His final resting place has become a place of remembrance for millions of fans and is one of the most visited graves in the world. Throughout the years since his burial, fans have not only paid their respects, but have left mementos at his gravesite. One such memento was a beautifully crafted bust of Morrison's head, according to Funeral Direct. This bust became a centerpiece of Morrison's memorial. In 2015, it was randomly stolen from Morrison's final resting place, but later returned.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-jim-morrison-pass-away-so-young>Why Did Jim Morrison Pass Away So Young?</h2><p>James Douglas Morrison was, by all means, <strong>a free spirit.</strong> Born during the final years of World War II, the young Morrison grew up in a military family. In his youth, he began to explore the arts and became passionate about literacy. Poetry, in particular, became a comfort in Morrison's life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/jim-morrison-was-arrested-during-multiple-doors-concerts-for-these-reasons-front-back-_-commons-licences.jpg><p>Also, at an early age, Morrison developed his rebellious persona. As can be expected, Morrison's behavior and ideologies did not sit well with his strict and proper father. Fortunately for Morrison, he lived his life unapologetically and pursed his passions head on, despite resistance from his father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/imi-hendrix-s-_purple-haze_-was-inspired-by-a-dark-dream.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The True Origin Behind Jimi Hendrix's Classic, Purple Haze">The True Origin Behind Jimi Hendrix's Classic, Purple Haze</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>A trippy dream inspired "Purple Haze," one of the most influential songs in rock history.</p><p>As a teenager, Morrison moved in with his grandparents in Florida as he began his college education. He later finished his education in California, getting a degree in the arts. After graduating college, Morrison moved to Venice Beach and began to write some of the most influential rock 'n' roll songs of his generation. Songs such as "Hello, I Love You" were composed before The Doors even became an official band. In 1965, The Doors embarked on their journey to become rock 'n' roll superstars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/the-doors-memorabilia-display-hard-rock-hotel-las-vegas-deposit-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Doors eventually earned national fame only two years after they formed. "Light My Fire" became a smash hit during the summer of 1967 and made Morrison a household name to a whole generation. While Morrison gained millions of fans, especially teenagers, he never gained the admiration of his father. After his father heard the first Doors record, he decided to write a letter to his son, suggesting that Morrison:</p><p>"Give up any idea of singing or any connection with a music group because of what I consider to be a complete lack of talent in this direction"</p><p>Morrison's troubled relationship with his father did not prevent the legend from pursuing his dreams, but it may have affected him on an emotional level. Perhaps it was the era in which he lived or his surroundings, but, Morrison was very much into substance culture. He did not care what people thought of his behavior and he did whatever he pleased. Even if that meant getting in legal trouble on stage. Morrison experimented with a variety of substances and his <strong>abuse could have played a significant role</strong> in his ultimate demise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/jim-morrison-allegedly-predicted-that-he-would-die-at-27-commons-licences.jpg><p>Morrison's fame only furthered his rebelliousness. The entertainer saw that millions of strangers liked him for who he was. Furthermore, he believed he could get away with almost anything due to his cultural status. He even refused to change song lyrics on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1967, according to Far Out. With a big ego, Morrison engaged in <strong>self-destructive behavior without any repercussions</strong>. This is what ultimately took the life of the young entertainer.</p><p>More than fifty years since his passing, Jim Morrison remains one of the most beloved frontmen in rock 'n' roll history. His legacy is unwavering and continues to gain new fans every year. The greatest tragedy in Morrison's life is that he did not live long enough to fully grasp his impact on music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihoqVdoryzvsispqdloKeypbXCrZydZZSarrW0jGtuZpucqq9w</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjim-morrison-predicted-death-27-club.html&text=Jim%20Morrison%20Allegedly%20Predicted%20That%20He%20Would%20Die%20And%20Join%20The%2027%20Club&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjim-morrison-predicted-death-27-club.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjim-morrison-predicted-death-27-club.html&title=Jim%20Morrison%20Allegedly%20Predicted%20That%20He%20Would%20Die%20And%20Join%20The%2027%20Club" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjim-morrison-predicted-death-27-club.html&title=Jim%20Morrison%20Allegedly%20Predicted%20That%20He%20Would%20Die%20And%20Join%20The%2027%20Club" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjim-morrison-predicted-death-27-club.html&title=Jim%20Morrison%20Allegedly%20Predicted%20That%20He%20Would%20Die%20And%20Join%20The%2027%20Club" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjim-morrison-predicted-death-27-club.html&description=Jim%20Morrison%20Allegedly%20Predicted%20That%20He%20Would%20Die%20And%20Join%20The%2027%20Club" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./just-sam-aka-samantha-diaz-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Just Sam (Singer) Wiki, Bio, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Sexuality, Age, Height, Weight, Career, Facts">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-nhls-top-10-all-time-penalty-minute-leaders.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The NHL's Top 10 All-Time Penalty Minute Leaders ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

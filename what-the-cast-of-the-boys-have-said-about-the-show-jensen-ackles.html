The show has been incredibly well received since it first started streaming in July 2019.

Elisabeth Shue was a regular in Season 1 and returned as a guest star in Season 2, while the likes of Colby Minifie, Aya Cash and Jensen Ackles joined after the first season had concluded.</p><p>Most of the stars – like the fans – are very fond of the work they have done so far. We have sampled some of the most notable things they have said about The Boys.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Erin Moriarty Really Feels About Her 'Boys' Castmates</a></span></p><h2 id=karl-urban-finds-his-character-fun-to-play><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Karl Urban Finds His Character Fun To Play</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Karl Urban starred in the MCU and in two of the three The Lord of the Rings movies <a href=#>before he was cast</a> to play William “Billy” Butcher in The Boys. It is a role he says he thoroughly enjoys, because of how unconventional it is.</p><p>“Billy is one of those characters who walks along the edge of a cliff and doesn’t blink,” Urban recently told Men’s Journal. “I find those roles very fun to play…the characters who dare to do and say things we would never personally do and say in real life.”</p><h2 id=jack-quaid-thinks-each-season-of-the-boys-keeps-raising-the-bar><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jack Quaid Thinks Each Season Of The Boys Keeps Raising The Bar</span></h2><p>The Hunger Games star Jack Quaid plays the role of Hugh “Hughie” Campbell Jr., considered by some to be the <a href=#>worst character on the show</a>. Not that the actor cares, as he feels that Season 3 has been better than Season 2, which was in turn a notch above Season 1.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“We definitely have more permission to go nuts [this season],” Quaid said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly in May. “I feel like every season we reset what the ceiling is, and somehow we push through it. I don’t know how we can keep raising the bar for messed-up things, but [creator] Eric [Kripke] keeps finding a way.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Was Jack Quaid Before 'The Boys'?</a></span></p><h2 id=antony-starr-also-feels-that-the-boys-has-found-a-way-to-remain-fresh><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Antony Starr Also Feels That The Boys Has Found A Way To Remain Fresh</span></h2><p>Like Jack Quaid, Antony Starr is impressed by the ability of the writers to keep the show fresh season in, season out. Starr portrays main antagonist John – popularized as “Homelander”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“One of the great things about this show is we keep evolving these characters from episode to episode, season to season as people evolve in real life,” Starr said in an interview with Slash Film, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">alongside co-star Erin Moriarty</a>. “I feel very lucky to work on a show where the freshness is maintained like that.”</p><h2 id=lsquo-herogasm-rsquo-was-erin-moriarty-rsquo-s-favorite-part-of-shooting-the-boys><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>‘Herogasm’ Was Erin Moriarty’s Favorite Part Of Shooting The Boys</span></h2><p>One of the most anticipated episodes of The Boys is <a href=#>titled Herogasm</a>, and – as the name suggests – is set to be the raunchiest of the show so far. During filming, the said sex-filled scene was the highlight for Erin Moriarty, who portrays Annie January / Starlight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I think my favorite part was observing the director of that episode directing the people in the background who are simulating sex,” she said, in the Slash Film interview. “Just observing him, and then him yelling, 'Cut,' and shaking his head like, 'What am I doing?'”</p><h2 id=dominique-mcelligott-does-not-view-queen-maeve-as-a-lsquo-gay-superhero-rsquo><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Dominique McElligott Does Not View Queen Maeve As A ‘Gay Superhero’</span></h2><p>In an age where representation is becoming central to most productions, Irish actress Dominique McElligott has had the special opportunity to play a queer superhero in The Boys. In her eyes though, her character is so much more than that.</p><p>“I never really looked at it from that perspective, from Maeve as a gay superhero. To me, she was [just] a superhero.” she said, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">previewing Season 3 of The Boys</a> with EW. “She's suppressing her sexuality, [but also] the fact that she's the strongest woman in the world.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About 'The Boys' Star Erin Moriarty's Relationship Status</a></span></p><h2 id=jessie-t-usher-is-happy-to-see-the-boys-tackle-social-issues><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jessie T. Usher Is Happy To See The Boys Tackle Social Issues</span></h2><p>While Dominique McElligott chooses to focus on the entirety of her character, her co-star Jessie T. Usher isn’t averse to shining a light on societal issues on The Boys.</p><p>“It’s nice to have a different take on the social issues,” the actor – who plays Reggie Franklin / A-Train – said recently. “I don’t think I have seen much content like that, so it’s very nice to have a project where they can blow those things up, and we can exploit them in a creative way.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=laz-alonso-thinks-covid-helped-the-show><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Laz Alonso Thinks COVID Helped The Show</span></h2><p>Star of Avatar Laz Alonso depicts the character Marvin T. "Mother's" Milk in The Boys. In a recent interview explaining the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">special connection he has with the show</a>, he revealed the positive impact he felt COVID had on their work.</p><p>“I'm not gonna lie: COVID did, I think, creatively help the writers come up with a bunch of new stuff,” he told LA Confidential earlier this month. “And I think people not being able to work for a whole year also pushed us to a whole other level.”</p><h2 id=jensen-ackles-was-a-huge-fan-of-the-boys-before-he-was-cast><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Jensen Ackles Was A Huge Fan Of The Boys Before He Was Cast</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jensen Ackles’ character in The Boys is created as a <a href=#>parody of Marvel’s Captain America</a>. He was offered the role by Eric Kripke, with whom he extensively worked on The CW’s Supernatural.</p><p>“I was such a fan of The Boys already. I told Kripke that I’ll come over and just do a bit part: ‘Just put me in coach!’” Ackles said to NME in early June.

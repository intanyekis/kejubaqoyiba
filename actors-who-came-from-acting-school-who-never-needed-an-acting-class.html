Whether these actors got where they needed to go through acting school or otherwise, it is interesting to uncover how they got their start.</p><h2 id=never-took-a-class-jim-carrey><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Never Took A Class: Jim Carrey</span></h2><p class=p1><a href=#>Jim Carrey</a> is an incredible actor who literally manifested his amazing career. He is a hilarious comedian who made a deal with himself that he was going to be successful and then follow through on that deal! Rather than taking acting classes, he went to various auditions and landed small acting roles until he was able to land his role on In Living Color. It was then that his career was able to skyrocket in the right direction and he was able to land a leading role in&nbsp;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=went-to-acting-school-hugh-jackman><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Went To Acting School: Hugh Jackman</span></h2><p class=p1><a href=#>Hugh Jackman</a> actually did attend acting school!

He grew up loving movies more than anything else and decided that acting was going to be the thing that was going to change his life. When he got older, he decided to move to New York City to pursue a career in acting. After only six months in New York City, he landed a role and a movie called Taps. A lot of actors spend years and years trying to get there a big break but for Tom Cruise, it took him six months!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=went-to-acting-school-glenn-close><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Went To Acting School: Glenn Close</span></h2><p class=p1>Glenn Close is an extremely dynamic and well-known actress who has taken on some amazingly huge roles in the past.

She decided that she wanted to leave Connecticut behind and move to New York City to study journalism. While she was in New York City is&nbsp;studying journalism, she ended up auditioning for commercials and TV shows. After landing a couple of commercials and working as an extra for several feature films, she realized that acting was definitely the right path for her. Those tiny parts only paved the way for her future career as a top actress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=went-to-acting-school-samira-wiley><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Went To Acting School: <span class=s1>Samira Wiley</span></span></h2><p class=p1>You’ll most likely recognize Samira Wiley from <a href=#>Orange Is the New Black</a>. The Netflix original show focuses on women who are imprisoned for various crimes and sheds light on what the prison system is really like.

Sometimes, people get plastic surgery to correct a genetic problem; sometimes, people get plastic surgery to correct a problem that’s come as a result of age; and still other times, people get plastic surgery to correct a problem that’s come as a result of an accident.</p><p>For Hollywood types, however, plastic surgery has a number of origins. People in Hollywood, for the most part, get plastic surgery to either look more “standard” for a role (in other words, get surgery that hides their ethnic heritage), or they get it to fight the ravages of time.</p><p>Sometimes, celebrity plastic surgery works out well. Sometimes, however, celebrity plastic surgery turns out so disastrous that the star becomes unrecognizable, and in the most extreme cases, the star never works again.</p><p>With this in mind, then, we’ve come up with a list of 10 people who should have said no to celebrity plastic surgery, and 10 people who did the right thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here’s the good, the bad, and the ugly…</p><h2 id=should-ve-said-no---lisa-rinna>Should've Said No - Lisa Rinna</h2><p>Even though she’s “only” known as a cast member of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa Rinna</a> is actually a very accomplished actress. She got her start in the soap world – specifically, Days of Our Lives – and eventually moved on to a role on Melrose Place, which is universally considered her “break-through” role. And though she’s a little older now, Lisa Rinna has been trying to keep up with the ever-progressing sands of time. Unfortunately, it seems as though she may have gone a little bit overboard, especially in her lips. Rinna freely admits that she’s a fan of plastic surgery, copping to getting silicone in her breasts, Botox on her face, and Juvederm in her lips. However, she’s said that of all the plastic surgery she’s ever gotten, she only regrets the Juvederm. Let’s hope she doesn’t get it again, then.</p><h2 id=right-choice---heidi-montag>Right Choice - Heidi Montag</h2><p>Love her or hate her, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heidi Montag</a> is part of our celebrity world now. Thanks to her part on MTV’s The Hills with her appropriately-named now-husband, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spencer Pratt</a>, Heidi Montag has become a part of the daily paparazzi “celebrity walk” and getting herself photographed on a daily basis. Believe it or not, too, she’s had some pretty good celebrity plastic surgery to make herself look just a little bit better than she did before. In addition to getting a very obvious nose and boob job (yeah, seriously), she’s gotten more than a bit of liposuction to make her body look tight and taut. While some people think she doesn’t look very good, we happen to disagree.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=should-ve-said-no---goldie-hawn>Should've Said No - Goldie Hawn</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Goldie Hawn</a> is yet another one of those Hollywood stars that was extremely pretty when she was younger. Her break-through performance on Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In in the 1960s made her beloved by people all over the United States, and her trademark slogan “Sock it to me!” endeared her to all of us. And yes, like many before her, she’s gone under the knife, but what she looks like today is a perfect example of what happens when you get bad celebrity plastic surgery. Goldie, you were pretty perfect before, and you had the opportunity to age with grace, but unfortunately, you didn’t. There’s nothing more unattractive than mutton trying to dress up as lamb.</p><h2 id=right-choice---blac-chyna>Right Choice - Blac Chyna</h2><p><a href=#>Blac Chyna</a> is another one of those celebrities you either love, hate, or love to hate. Whatever your opinion of her, however, she was the only woman who could rock the Kardashian/Jenner empire to the core when she had a “revenge baby” with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rob Kardashian, Jr.</a>, after Rob’s half-sister, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner</a>, took up with Blac Chyna’s baby daddy, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tyga</a>. (Are you keeping up with all of this?) While Blac Chyna was always naturally pretty, the celebrity plastic surgery made her look like a knock-out. A little bit of lipo, a lot of breast implants, and a few lip injections make her look like a supermodel coming down the runway. We don’t care what anyone says – we love you, Blac Chyna!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=should-ve-said-no---heather-locklear>Should've Said No - Heather Locklear</h2><p>In her prime, back in the crazy 1980s, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heather Locklear</a> redefined the word gorgeous. Tall, thin, and standard-issue California blonde-and-tan, Locklear had everything that an actress could ever want: money, success, fame, and glamour. But after her career began stalling in the early aughts – along with her love life, which should have been expected given that she’s marrying rock stars – she started going under the knife just a little too much. Now, she looks like a total disaster after getting some pretty horrendous celebrity plastic surgery. Take a look at her before and after – her cheeks, especially, are just way too full. Hey, we’ll always have her early photos to remember her by…</p><h2 id=right-choice---kendall-jenner>Right Choice - Kendall Jenner</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kendall Jenner</a> may be known as the “supermodel” of the Kardashian/Jenner clan because of her ability to walk down the runway for such companies as Victoria’s Secret, but let’s face it: she didn’t always look as good as she did. Like her more famous half-sisters – <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Khloe, Kim, and Kourtney Kardashian</a> – she got some much-needed celebrity plastic surgery, where she went from Plain Jane to Pretty Baby. Granted, it’s hard to picture what Kendall Jenner looked like before the surgery, but never fear, we’re here to help you!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=should-ve-said-no---jennifer-grey>Should've Said No - Jennifer Grey</h2><p>The daughter of Broadway legend Joel Grey, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Grey</a> made herself known around Hollywood with a few bit parts in films like Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, but she really got her breakthrough role as Baby in the mega-hit film Dirty Dancing, opposite the late <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patrick Swayze</a>. Jennifer mostly became known for her distinctive looks, specifically thanks to her nose. In fact, she became so known for her distinctive looks that when she got plastic surgery, she effectively ended her career. It wasn’t that this celebrity plastic surgery was bad, necessarily – in fact, Jennifer looks quite beautiful, both before and after – but it rendered her unrecognizable, even to her friends. Jennifer herself said that the plastic surgery had a negative impact on her career, and that she was considering changing her name to start her career anew. “I went in the operating room a celebrity—and came out anonymous. It was like being in a witness protection program or being invisible,” she said.</p><h2 id=right-choice---ariana-grande>Right Choice - Ariana Grande</h2><p>Granted, she’s still pretty young – especially compared to the others on this list – but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana Grande</a> still had some celebrity plastic surgery to make herself look just a little bit better. Judging by her before and after photos, however, it seems that some of her improved look comes from the fact that she lost a little bit of that “baby weight.” However, it’s also pretty obvious that she got a nose job to look just a little bit better than she did before. (Not that she looked bad pre-surgery, but the added, uh, edge to her nose makes her look that much better.)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=should-ve-said-no---donatella-versace>Should've Said No - Donatella Versace</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Donatella Versace</a> took over the legendary Versace fashion house in 1995 after her beloved brother, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gianni</a>, was murdered by a deranged fan. Since then, she’s dressed nearly every celebrity alive, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madonna</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady Gaga</a>. While Donatella has made some beautiful clothes, her celebrity plastic surgery is anything but beautiful – too much silicone in her lips, too many injections into her cheeks, and too much time in the blistering Italian sun has left Donatella looking terrible. With that said, she’s been through some pretty rough times – in addition to dealing with her brother Gianni’s death, she’s had to deal with the fact that her daughter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Allegra Beck</a>, was suffering from an extreme form of anorexia that nearly killed her – so we’ll give her somewhat of a pass.</p><h2 id=right-choice---gwyneth-paltrow>Right Choice - Gwyneth Paltrow</h2><p>Another Hollywood actress that has gone from girl-next-door to glamazon is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwyneth Paltrow</a>. The daughter of actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blythe Danner</a> and director <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bruce Paltrow</a>, Gwyneth seemed destined for stardom. However, it wasn’t until she got some much-needed celebrity plastic surgery that she went from legacy kid to million-dollar baby. All it took was a bit of a trim to her nose to make it look more Hollywood standard, and – allegedly – a bit of a cheek implant to become the Goopy genius we all know and love (or love to hate, depending on your point of view).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=should-ve-said-no---kim-basinger>Should've Said No - Kim Basinger</h2><p>At the prime of her career, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Basinger</a> was called the most beautiful woman alive, and she frequently made the top of People Magazine’s Most Beautiful People list. Naturally, when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alec Baldwin</a> married her, he was considered the luckiest man alive. But a series of bad movies, bad investments, and bad celebrity plastic surgery left Basinger looking none the worse for wear. As we can see from her before and after photos, she went from Hollywood bombshell to Wisconsin soccer mom (and the hair doesn’t help, either). Taken individually, she doesn’t look bad, but taken all together, she looks like a disaster. It’s a shame, too, because no matter what she looks like, Kim Basinger was – and is – a talented actress.</p><h2 id=right-choice---jennifer-garner>Right Choice - Jennifer Garner</h2><p>Jennifer Garner, the Alias star and soon-to-be ex-wife of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Affleck</a>, is one of the prettiest women in Hollywood, so it came as a little bit of a shock when it was discovered that she had some celebrity plastic surgery. But as the before and after pictures show, our girl definitely had a bit of work done. In addition to the nose job, Garner also had some wonderful veneers put on her teeth so that her smile looked just a little more uniform. It’s not that the bunny teeth weren’t oh-so-cute, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Garner</a> now looks absolutely stunning.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=should-ve-said-no---renee-zellweger>Should've Said No - Renee Zellweger</h2><p>Like Jennifer Grey, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Renee Zellweger</a> is someone who got some pretty good celebrity plastic surgery, but it’s listed in the “bad” category because, like Jennifer’s surgery, Renee’s surgery irreparably damaged her career. In fact, when she debuted her new look, many people were wondering if, in fact, they were face-to-face with the real Renee. Many theories about her transformation popped up, but the funniest one was the speculation that the real Renee Zellweger was dead, and the woman standing in her place was a clone put out by the Illuminati. Sure, Jan.</p><h2 id=right-choice---gretchen-rossi>Right Choice - Gretchen Rossi</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gretchen Rossi</a>, is one of those celebrities that’s just “famous for being famous.” But this member of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills has one very good thing going for her: some awesome celebrity plastic surgery! Like many of the other women on this list, she’s gotten herself a nose job, but she’s also gotten some contouring done on her jaw and cheekbones to make her very square face look more aquiline and Hollywood ready. Whether that “Hollywood ready” face will translate to other jobs in the future remains to be seen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=should-ve-said-no---darryl-hannah>Should've Said No - Darryl Hannah</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Darryl Hannah</a> was another actress who got her start as a model in the 1980s, and she quickly became a sought-after actress. She made headlines all over the world when it got out that she was dating John F. Kennedy Jr., and this led many to believe that Hannah and Kennedy would signify the perfect marriage of Hollywood and DC. Unfortunately, after JFK Jr. tragically died, her career went into a tailspin, and like so many others before her, she got some of the worst celebrity plastic surgery you can imagine. No longer the gorgeous ingenue of the 1980s, Darryl Hannah looks like a cross between an angry school-marm and a romantic fiction writer. Not a good look, Darryl.</p><h2 id=right-choice---julia-roberts>Right Choice - Julia Roberts</h2><p>From girl-next-door to Hollywood mega-star, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Julia Roberts</a> has had a career trajectory that many actresses can only dream of. And Roberts is also one of the few actresses who has had some of the most amazing celebrity plastic surgery – in fact, it’s so amazing that you can’t tell she’s had it, which is the point of good plastic surgery in the first place. But if you look at her “before” and “after” photos, you can see that, in addition to straightening her gorgeous curls – making her look sleek – she’s had a bit of a nose job. Nothing too drastic, as you can see – but enough to make an amazing difference in her appearance!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=should-ve-said-no---joan-van-ark>Should've Said No - Joan Van Ark</h2><p>Many people reading this are, perhaps, too young to remember Joan Van Ark when she was in her prime. The actress, who got her start on Broadway, shot to fame when she earned the role of Valene Ewing, which she played on Dallas, Knott’s Landing, and the Dallas reboot. But unfortunately, Joan Van Ark is the epitome of bad celebrity plastic surgery. Clearly, as the before and after pictures show, the once fresh-faced actress looks tired and haggard, and there’s been entirely too many chemical peels done. We, of course, don’t expect a woman to look the same at 70 as she does at 30, but one would suspect that Joan Van Ark would look much better if she didn’t go under the knife too much.</p><h2 id=right-choice---sarah-jessica-parker>Right Choice - Sarah Jessica Parker</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah Jessica Parker</a> got her big break when she was cast as Carrie Bradshaw in the hit HBO show, Sex and the City. Before that, however, she had a few bit parts in a few different Hollywood films before she got married to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew Broderick</a> and had a bunch of beautiful kids. But it took Sex and the City to give Parker her “big break” because she needed to get some very necessary celebrity plastic surgery, and obviously, the biggest change was in her nose. But sometimes, a little change can go a long way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=should-ve-said-no---jocelyn-wildenstein>Should've Said No - Jocelyn Wildenstein</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jocelyn Wildenstein</a> is the perfect living, breathing example of what not to do when you’re going for celebrity plastic surgery. Wildenstein is more known for her terrible plastic surgery than she is for her accomplishments, which is a shame, because her resume is actually pretty impressive. Born Jocelyne Périsset in Switzerland, Wildenstein is an accomplished hunter and pilot from a rich socialite family who married businessman Alec Wildenstein when they were introduced by a Saudi arms dealer. The Wildensteins are a family of art benefactors, and they had two children. Sadly, Jocelyn looks the way she does after $4 million in plastic surgery, which was done all to please her now-ex-husband (he apparently had a fascination with lions and tigers). Despite what people say about her look, she’s reportedly “very happy” with the results, and she “got everything she wanted.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, not all celebrity plastic surgery is bad plastic surgery. There are some famous people, in fact, whose plastic surgery is so amazing that it defies explanation. Let’s take a look at some of the better examples of celebrity plastic surgery.</p><h2 id=right-choice---chelsea-clinton>Right Choice - Chelsea Clinton</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chelsea Clinton</a> isn’t a proper celebrity, per se, so much as she is a political scion of one of the greatest legacies in American history. But when Chelsea first came to the forefront, she was made fun of regularly because of what she looked like. It wasn’t that she was ugly, per se, so much as she was a teenager going through some awkward years. But when she became an adult, she went ahead and got herself some great celebrity plastic surgery, and got the nose she’d hated for a long time fixed into something more utilitarian. In the process, she went from pretty to just plain gorgeous.

But I can't remember the story of the beginning.</p><p>No. Sharon got pregnant at 16 I think, long before Nick. The baby daddy didn’t want to be a daddy so Sharon give up the child. Long after Nick and Sharon got married, Grace came to town and she found Cassie and Sharon got her child back. She taught Nick wouldn’t understand but he did and he adopted Cassie as his. The entire Newman clan loved her. I think Cassie was 5 at the time when she came to town. It’s been so long so I don’t it’s a little vivid. Suddenly Victor acts like he had no feelings for the child so he got a look alike to drive Sharon crazy.</p><p>No. Matt Clark was Cassie’s biological father.</p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>pondie</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>August 24, 2014, 2:13am <span itemprop=position>4</span></span><p>Quote <strong>Soap Fan</strong>: No. Matt Clark was Cassie's biological father.</p><p>Cassie’s father was Frank.

In 2001, Matt Clark came back from the dead having had plastic surgery and called himself Carter Mills. That’s when he told Nick that he’d raped Sharon and Nick wanted her to have an abortion Sharon miscarried but the baby was Nick’s. Cassie was born before Sharon came to GC so there was never a chance that she was Nick’s.</p><p>Frank was indeed the father of Sharon’s baby. He was an auto mechanic in Madison, Wisconsin and made one possibly no more than two appearances on Y&R. He was not daddy material.</p><p>I think all the soap history of each character is available online using Google.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvIrGSnoZOgerW0xGaZoqecpLSqr8ClZJ%2BZpJ2ys3nOn2ScmaOotqZ7kWlrcWtg</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-nick-the-biological-father-of-cassie.html&text=is%20Nick%20the%20biological%20father%20of%20Cassie%20-%20The%20Young%20and%20the%20Restless&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-nick-the-biological-father-of-cassie.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-nick-the-biological-father-of-cassie.html&title=is%20Nick%20the%20biological%20father%20of%20Cassie%20-%20The%20Young%20and%20the%20Restless" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-nick-the-biological-father-of-cassie.html&title=is%20Nick%20the%20biological%20father%20of%20Cassie%20-%20The%20Young%20and%20the%20Restless" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-nick-the-biological-father-of-cassie.html&title=is%20Nick%20the%20biological%20father%20of%20Cassie%20-%20The%20Young%20and%20the%20Restless" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-nick-the-biological-father-of-cassie.html&description=is%20Nick%20the%20biological%20father%20of%20Cassie%20-%20The%20Young%20and%20the%20Restless" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./max-scherzer-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Max Scherzer Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hopie-carlson-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-372652-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hopie Carlson Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

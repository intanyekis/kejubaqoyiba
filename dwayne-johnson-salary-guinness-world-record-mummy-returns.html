His career did not follow the same trajectory as others, DJ was thrust into the Hollywood spotlight instantly thanks to his fame in sports entertainment.

On Thursday, he had hair and makeup and wardrobe. And I shot him on Friday. I only shot him for one day. I had one day with him, because, on Saturday morning, he had to fly from the Sahara desert to Detroit for a big wrestling deal. He arrives on the set Friday morning and Dwayne had really bad food poisoning and heat stroke."</p><p>''It was probably 110, 112 degrees, and everybody’s in shorts and tank tops, and he would be covered in blankets, just shivering. And he is such a trooper. I will always love him, because I’m like, ‘Dwayne, we’ve only got one day! I can’t put it off! We can’t wait for you to get well!’ He goes, just get the camera rolling, and as soon as I hear ‘Background’ I’ll jump up.’ And that’s what he did. We did, ‘…and background!’ All the extras start going and I go, ‘Action!’ and Dwayne, he threw off the blankets and charged forward. And we just went all day.

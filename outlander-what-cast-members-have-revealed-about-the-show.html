Balfe admits that it was an intense scene to shoot, but one that she drew excitement from, rather than nerves. This excitement is what helped propel her forward, through the chaos.</p><h2 id=richard-rankin-enjoyed-driving-the-crew-crazy-with-his-constant-singing><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Richard Rankin Enjoyed Driving The Crew Crazy With His Constant Singing</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/roger-rankin-singing-e1591810967254.jpg><p>Anyone who has seen interviews with Richard Rankin - who is indeed a skilled musician in real life - will have undoubtedly noted his contagious sense of humor.

Everything the fans see has been choreographed down to each movement, no matter how small, so that it looks and feels as real as it can be.

The Battle of Culloden was a rough scene for everyone, and from a fan's point of view, the cinematography is flawless. While both Menzies and Heughan had stunt doubles who were able to fill in if needed, they both chose to commit to the scene in a personal way, as there were many close-ups that weren't appropriate for doubles, anyway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything The Game Of Thrones Cast Has Said About The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=sophie-skelton-studied-her-on-screen-parents-in-order-to-capture-a-realistic-likeness><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Sophie Skelton Studied Her On-Screen Parents In Order To Capture A Realistic Likeness</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/outlander-cast.jpg><p>When Sophie entered the picture, it was like watching a miniature, female version of Jamie come to life onscreen.

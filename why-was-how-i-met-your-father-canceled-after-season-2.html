"We're kind of in an interesting sort of spin-off world or redo worlds, right?" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he told Insider</a>. "There's Wonder Years that's happening again. And there's lots of different shows that are sort of remounting in different iterations."</p><p>He added: "They had tried to make a How I Met Your Father a couple of times before and so It's nice to see that this one's sticking. I hope it lands." Harris made a cameo in season 2 of HIMYF, reprising <a href=#>his role as Barney Stinson</a>. In March 2023, Duff said it was a chaotic day on set.</p><p>"He had so much to do that day, he had pages and pages of dialogue, and everything that could go wrong went wrong," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told Entertainment Weekly</a>. "Some crew guy got hurt and there was an ambulance, it was pouring down rain, of course on the only night that we had him, and we're outside, and we'd already shot stuff leading up to this night where it wasn't raining."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=#>underpaid Lizzie McGuire star</a> said that filming with Harris ended up being "so funny" and that she "broke [laughing] 100 times."

"What a gut punch!" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one wrote on Reddit</a>. "Season 2 they really found their stride, every episode was a banger and I was feeling that comfort you feel when you settle into a great sitcom which I haven’t felt since HIMYM concluded."</p><p>Another one added: "I really enjoyed the last half of the second season… it seemed like the writers had found a good rhythm and the characters were starting to feel natural.

Everything was done in the original, they covered it all..."</p><p>Duff saw the comment, to which she replied, "you have 63 followers." As of this writing, the <a href=#>mother of three</a> hasn't made an official statement about the show's cancelation. However, fans think it must be related to the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.</p><p>"Unfortunately it's not just Disney that will be affected. So it's not completely his [Disney's CEO Robert Iger] fault," someone said on Reddit. "Although he did say some horrible things about the strike that is unacceptable. The strike can and mostly likely will affect shows on other networks movies too."</p><p>They continued: "That's why all the actors are standing with them because it affects them too. They really need to treat the writers better without them they won't have any entertainment to make money off of so they should pay them better."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another user suggested that Iger could do something to revive the series. "Specifically in the case of HIMYF's cancellation, though, it wouldn't be inaccurate to point the finger at Iger, since he's the CEO of Disney which owns both the majority of Hulu and the entirety of 20th Century Television, the studio that produces HIMYF," they said.</p><p>They went on to say that therefore, "one can blame the strikes, work stoppages and the contraction of the streaming industry, but Iger likely has the ability to save some shows from the chopping block and he chose not to spare HIMYF."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdrK60eceormahXaKytXnYqKyrZZaWwamx0WaamqaTmrmmsIyana2domLApq3SqKVmal8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-was-how-i-met-your-father-canceled-after-season-2.html&text=Why%20Was%20How%20I%20Met%20Your%20Father%20Canceled%20After%20Season%202%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-was-how-i-met-your-father-canceled-after-season-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-was-how-i-met-your-father-canceled-after-season-2.html&title=Why%20Was%20How%20I%20Met%20Your%20Father%20Canceled%20After%20Season%202%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-was-how-i-met-your-father-canceled-after-season-2.html&title=Why%20Was%20How%20I%20Met%20Your%20Father%20Canceled%20After%20Season%202%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-was-how-i-met-your-father-canceled-after-season-2.html&title=Why%20Was%20How%20I%20Met%20Your%20Father%20Canceled%20After%20Season%202%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-was-how-i-met-your-father-canceled-after-season-2.html&description=Why%20Was%20How%20I%20Met%20Your%20Father%20Canceled%20After%20Season%202%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kristen-luman-ghost-hunters.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="wiki, bio, net worth, career, getting to know.">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-are-lily-collinss-parents-lily-collins-biography-parents-name-nationality-and-more-2-520034-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who are Lily Collinss Parents?
